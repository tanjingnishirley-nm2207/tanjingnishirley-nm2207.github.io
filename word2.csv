"jokes! When my wife got me to the hospital, the doctors thought I had a mental breakdown. Several months later, I was given the news: A rare progressive neurological condition that would shorten my life considerably. To make matters worse, the same condition that my abusive Father died of. The first five years of marriage, my wife and I took care of my parents. Knowing the outcome of my diagnosis has been terrifying! I discovered very quickly that I am in this alone. No one wants to be bothered with someone who is no longer healthy. Social media was my one shot to reconnect with people who I thought might want to rekindle a friendship. I was sadly mistaken. Most just want to know if you became successful, or if you turned out to be a loser. I’m an incredibly strong man. I’ve had to be. I went from being an extremely happy, overly energetic person, to a shell of my former self. What hurts is that no one has even noticed. When tragedy strikes, throngs of people hit the airwaves to offer kindness to total strangers. I could use some that myself! I can deal with being alone. I’ve had no choice. It’s the loneliness that eats at you; knowing that no one cares any longer.The past two years since my marriage ended have been hell and heartbreak. I really want to be happy and try to stay hopeful but its hard.My mom died a month ago, and I feel as if the whole world has continued moving but I’m still stuck in that hospital room with her. It’s a devastating loneliness to watch life happen around you and you’re not able to take part.It’s my first year of college. Everybody says that it’s supposed to be the best time of your life. I don’t see how. I had amazing friends at home, and a boyfriend, and I am super close with my mom. I was excited to make new friends here, though. But the people I hang out with I don’t consider my friends. I don’t have any connections with any of them, and I can’t seem to feel that connection with anybody. I feel like there’s something wrong with me. Everybody else here seems to be doing just fine, my hometown friends are excelling in their social lives, the people I’ve been hanging out with all seem to feel that connection with each other. I’m the odd one out. I spend my time studying and alone, as I’d rather spend my time alone than with people I can’t seem to click with. Not a day goes by that I don’t feel lonely.The loneliest time in my life was the summer of 1981. It was the summer Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer got married; I was 13 years old. My parents had moved my older brother and me from Toronto to the Cobourg area (about an hour east of Toronto) a couple years before because they decided to pursue their dream of being small business owners and an opportunity in Cobourg presented itself that they couldn’t resist. When we first moved to Cobourg my parents rented houses and in the summer of 1981 we were house sitting for the summer in a rural area just north of Cobourg called Baltimore. My parents were often gone to work before I woke up and didn’t return home before I was already in bed for the night. My brother was old enough to help out with the family business so he was often gone with my parents but there was no place for me at the family business so I was by myself in this strange house for the entire summer. Too young to drive, too far out to walk or ride my bike to visit any friends so I was just stuck there. In the middle of nowhere with nothing to do, no computers or internet or social media back then, we didn’t have any family pets and the lone black and white TV only got three channels. The radio was my only company during those lonely months and I would spend my days singing along and dancing around the house to the songs on the radio. Although I loved the songs at the time (“The Friends of Mr. Cairo” by Jon Anderson of YES and “Gemini Dreams” by The Moody Blues, for example) when I hear those songs now they bring me right back to that lonely summer as a kid and make me incredibly sad. I often change the radio station or just turn it off.My mom was recently diagnosed with a very aggressive form of cancer. She’s had surgery and is hopefully now cancer free. But mine and my family’s lives have been consumed by it. I barely saw my parents for a month while my mom was in the hospital. We didn’t want to risk me bringing in a cold or something because it could’ve killed her with her demolished immune system. That being said, I’ve been looking forward to Halloween all year. My dad and I always go all out with the decorations. And even set up a haunted house for little kids. But this year my dad is too busy helping my mom. Normally my friends would come and help in this situation, but they are all much too busy with their lives at the moment. Right now is the longest I’ve gone without seeing them since we met in high school. So I’ve been trying to decorate on my own. Today I cried while holding a skeleton, I feel like I’ve had to grow up in the past two months. I didn’t realize I wasn’t ready to do so...As I sit here writing this, I realize that although I have a girlfriend and a really cool mom, I don’t have anyone I can talk to really. Over the past several months, I have been getting sexually harassed at work by a guy who will turn on a dime and start threatening my job if he ever got the sense that I wasn’t interested in him. As a gay woman, he is far from my type, but I felt like in order to maintain the peace I had to just accept it. I finally went to my manager and told her that was going on and while she was very apologetic, stood by while HR did nothing. He was told not to do it again. I was told to keep it together. Around the same time, I started back to school to work on my doctorate. Going back to school for another degree is difficult enough without dealing with some creep asking to see me naked or trying to find out where I live. I tried to talk to my girlfriend and she told me that I basically needed to not stress about it. Over the course of the past several weeks, things have gotten progressively worse, with an increase in migraines and a vandalized car being the least of my problems. I had to make the decision to drop out of school because of failing grades and all I wanted to do was talk to my girlfriend about it. But I can’t. Because she tells me that I’m too negative and I’m afraid that she’ll leave me if I keep talking to her about the things that are on my mind. I’m surrounded by people but have no one that will give me a second to cry or grieve or whatever I need to do to get through this.I left the home, I left her, rented a room. Spent my weekends driving around or listening to the radio in a parking lot in my car, without a home, without a family. Looking back I‘m amazed I survived it. Although my life if much better now, I look forward to meeting someone again and maybe have a family.When I realized that the man I was married to was really an alcoholic and he didn‘t want to put his family/children‘s needs above his compulsive drinking, when he told me that he didnt want another child when I was seven months pregnant with my second child, when I realized he was taking money to support his drinking and I was the parent that had to keep telling our kids that we just cant afford whatever it was that they wanted at that time in their lives. I feel the most alone when I realize I was never truly and completely loved and I will never be loved and cherished.Loneliness is something I live with most of the time; I only have my partner and dogs for company, so when he goes away on business, which is often, I spend days without speaking or seeing anyone. I long for friendship but I struggle with social anxiety. We moved to a new area a year ago and we don‘t know anyone. At first I tried to join new things so I could meet people, but I started to have panic attacks beforehand and eventually gave up. I find it too stressful to meet people, even people I know, who aren‘t close family or my partner - I worry about being judged and I over analyse every social interaction - its maddening and in some ways being lonely is preferable to the stress. I know I need professional help to overcome this, but that in itself would trigger my social anxiety - so it‘s a hard cycle to escape from.Freshman year of high school (a common trope, I know). For weeks at the beginning of the year I would spend my lunches crying in the back bathroom stall, and panic attacks became my only companion. I would try to gag myself so I could go home sick and cry myself to sleep. It doesn‘t help that I‘m gay and I have nobody to confide in. I‘m bursting at the seams. I feel like such a freak, and on top of that, being friendless doesn‘t help either. Im scared to come out because I dont want to be known as the lesbian in an all girls school I guess. You start to feel like there must be something wrong with you. It cant truly be possible to be this lonely if I was a person worth being around. I dont think Ive ever felt so alone.My significant other has a big family. A few years ago I was with her at a family event, in a room with probably 30 other people, and I realized I hadn’t spoken a word to anyone in over an hour. I started having a panic attack so I went for a walk to calm down. I just intended to go around the block but wound up walking for close to an hour. I finally came back and no one realized I was gone. I was a background player and no one saw that I left. Pretty sure I could have kept going and never come back, and it would have been no big deal.I separated from my partner a couple of years ago. In my determination to get out into the world in those first few months of singledom I decided to go to a theatre production that I really wanted to see but had no one to go with. I told myself that didn‘t matter, proceeded to buy my ticket and travelled to the theatre. Settled into my seat which turned out to be sandwiched between two couples. The production began and although the performances were excellent, I couldn‘t help but feel self conscious when laughing alone at a funny part, with no one to share the reaction with. I ended up leaving at the intermission, rationalizing that I would beat the crowds on the train home. I haven‘t been to the theatre since.I feel lonely all the time. Floating in the universe with no one who really gets what I‘m about. I don‘t even get what I‘m about. I know I have time to figure it out, but time either goes too slow or too fast.I live in Busan and my life is going to be bored and not natural. People are different culture is unknown. I study here but can not learn anything. I want to make new friends but they can not speak in English, Russian, Uzbek or Turkish. I know I will adopt to Korea and I hope it will not take much time.I went from being a well-paid teacher to someone who is trying to exist on the breadline. A year after breaking my leg, my pay reduced to 50% and eventually stopped, so I made the decision to take early retirement which meant living on a very small private pension. At least this gave me an income. The State pension wouldn‘t be available for another 6 years. I thought I could manage with savings. What I hadn‘t considered was how isolated I would become. Everyone important to me were a lot wealthier than I am, enjoying social lives I could no longer afford. I spiralled into a deep depression and didn‘t know how to ask for help. I had spent my life putting others first. Even in depression, I put on an act so not to place my burden onto others. I started to withdraw from social contact, it was easier to stay at home where I could be ‘safe. Also, a lot of the people around me were of the get a grip  response to mental illness. I felt inadequate enough, I didnt need friends telling me to get a grip. Gradually, Ive built up a life with volunteering, looking after my grandchildren, joining groups which cost very little, but, I still feel lonely for that one person who would provide companionship in old age. I feel very vulnerable for the first time in my life!My first week from college. I didn‘t know anyone around, and hence couldn‘t leave the house to have fun somewhere else. I‘m a bit of an introvert, so making friends has always been difficult. Added to the fact that I‘m generally terrified of being outed to a homophobic neighbourhood, it felt especially harder to make new friends. But, we survive. Im talking to a few people now, and am generally trying to live each day as it comes.New Year‘s Eve from age 16-25.During hospital stays for my anorexia nervosa. Surrounded by so many lovely people who are just as stuck and alone in their own minds as I am.The most lonely moment of my life was when I was standing naked in the shower with my girlfriend and she yelled at me that she would like to punch my fucking face. My girlfriend was raped as a teenager and she couldn‘t cope with men. She loved me but she detested me at the same time. I was standing there naked in the shower, warm water ran over me while being yelled at with threats and all I wanted was to give her a hug and comfort her.I lived with people who were only interested in staying indoors. My uni friends just never invited me to do anything with them. I ended up going on a trip to another town and going ice skating alone. I‘m glad I did because that‘s the most fun I had at that time. I‘m still friends with my uni friends, but I‘m now living with new people. The people I live with now actually have an interest in joining me on my adventures. Its much better now.We moved from the UK to New Zealand when I was a kid in the 60s, there was a lot of anti-English sentiment back then, I was called “pommy Sue”. My parents were very busy establishing a new life and I wasn’t accepted by the kids at school, I had to get myself ready for school alone and I would come home to an empty house. I wasn’t allowed a pet so I trapped a bird in the garden and kept it in a shed, ostensibly to look after it, after a couple of days it died of fright and I felt incredibly guilty.The whole of 2016 I spent alone; I was single after a heavy breakup, I saw my friends maybe only once every two months and I loved it! I had the most productive year towards my music and art, learned and understood new aspects of myself and indulged in pleasures I had been wanting to fer years. It was truly a valuable time in that I learnt that loneliness wasn‘t completely a bad thing, and now I truly treasure the times I have to myself. It‘s made a stronger, more understanding person with greater relationships than I could have ever fathomed. I truly relish those times.My mother and grandmother lived together for over 3 decades. I would help them out - all the time - meals, errands, visits. I loved it. My mother died in 2013 - medical error. My grandmother died 6 months later at 96. They gave me a sense of purpose - I loved them so much. I mattered to them. The loss was unimaginable and I never really talked about it with anyone, because it was so big...deep...a piece of me went with them. How do you explain that to someone else? How is such pain conveyed? I dreaded the thought of sharing it with someone only to have them respond with something like...Well one time I had this terrible loss and it was so sad and xyz - at which point I would stop listening and feel worse and wonder how it could be that we humans had come to be such poor communicators. To be heard; to matter - how do we get that back as a species?When I was nine, my tonsils were removed, though I wasn‘t told it would happen. In 1957, anesthetic for children was imprecise, and I awakened flat on my back on the operating room table. Held down. When home, I couldn‘t manage to speak, was severely claustrophobic and nothing seemed real.My very first party was freshman year, the day before my 15th birthday. It was a really nice party, actually, with fairy lights and nice people from other schools and a lot of dark beer. And vodka — which I had a preference for. One of my friends felt depressed and I didn‘t want to leave her alone, but I also wanted to keep drinking, so I grabbed a bottle of rose vodka. I guess I felt like that night was supposed to be a rite of passage or something. We walked to this peach tree orchard at the center of our town, only a few blocks away, but by then I was drunk out of my mind. I couldn‘t even walk, I kept stumbling into fire hydrants. The last thing I remember from that night was shrieking, “I love you!” to her half-sickened-half-concerned face. I woke up the next morning at like 3 am and it was horrible, the worst I‘ve ever felt in my whole life. All my friends and a few strangers were sleeping in the next room over and I was in some guy‘s shirt because my friend didn‘t have any clothes that fit me. And it was my birthday. I stumbled over to her couch and sat on it and the world was just so quiet. Suddenly, I was 15 years old and hungover and everything hurt because I was scraped-up. There were thorns in my feet because I‘d walked barefoot places. I‘ve never felt so alone in my life. I wanted to be held so badly. For someone to tell me that it was okay, to stop crying, even wish me a happy birthday. I felt so small and afraid. I put my hands between my thighs and just kept looking at my toes and how chipped up my coral nail polish was even though I‘d got them done with my mom the day before. I remember all of this viscerally. The morning stars, the silent TV, and me. Nobody comforted me when they woke up finally, obviously, besides a few comments about how scared people got when my pulse began to stutter. I don‘t think they knew it was my birthday either, so I got no birthday wishes. But that didnt hurt so much. What hurt was when my mom picked me up. My mom‘s very principled about these things. I think she could tell what happened the moment I got into the car because I reeked of vodka. She didn‘t speak to me at all for the entire day. She‘s usually the one who buys cake and stuff, who gets really happy about birthdays. She canceled the big dinner we were supposed to have that night with all our family friends without telling me. That was the first time we didn‘t really celebrate. My dad didnt say anything to me either. It was like I was blanked out for that whole day. No one could even look at me. That was the loneliest Ive ever felt — when I everyone I loved made me feel like I didn‘t exist, made me feel like I was repulsive and not worth anything. It was my fault and I probably deserved it, but it still made me feel so awful and alone. That no one would forgive me or at least held me with such unconditional positive regard that they could look past this mistake for one day, that day, my birthday — it hurt so much. Anyways, I still can‘t eat anything that tastes of rosewater.The first time his symptoms were bad enough to keep us housebound for several days.I feel lonely most nights when I am in bed. When all I want is to cuddle someone and feel loved and to feel seen and held. It is hard to explain. But I am not into the gay scene and I don‘t identify with that scene at all. But this means I rarely ever meet other likeminded gay men. I am not obviously gay to other people, who always assume I am straight. It means I am left to use apps like Grindr. Grindr is a place where loneliness is abundant. Where people seek a quick fix to there current feeling of isolation and loneliness.It makes me so fearful for my future. How will I ever meet someone, how will I ever find love, that deep meaningful connection, where that one special person sees you in your entirety, the good and the bad and accepts it wholeheartedly and loves me for who I am. That person who is there to dream my dreams with me and hold me when they don‘t work out. That person who will be there as my health fails, that person who will walk the dark paths with me as well as the light ones.I have so much to offer and sometimes I feel like a balloon filling up to the point I will burst. To me, living in a world that places people on boxes, straight, gay or whatever, makes me feel like I don‘t belong and I will not ever meet the man who could walk alongside me in life. To me loneliness is a poverty of opportunity to meet that someone. It is looking around at all my friends and seeing them dating and falling in love and feeling left behind.I felt the most lonely a few months ago, when I found out my partner had been seeing other people. Suddenly I couldn‘t trust him any more, and I realised that by focusing on our relationship I had isolated myself from the few friends i‘d had. He on the other hand, had an ever growing network of friends, that I of course was not welcome to be a part of. I‘d been so content on being the perfect girl for him, that he would always want to be with, that I didnt even realise he was taking advantage of my kindheartedness, as well as gas-lighting and subtly controlling me. Im still in that relationship, because I have nowhere else to go, and dont have the mental or financial capability to be on my own.When I went through 3rd grade being bullied, picked on, and excluded. Then I moved. 4th grade would be so much better, I thought – but by the end of it, I only had one friend. By the end of 5th grade, she had betrayed me and left me lonely yet again. In 6th grade, I finally found a friend group. In 7th grade, all but two of my friends left me because I was annoying and also a lesbian – and in the second half of the year, those two decided to ditch me for a month just to see what happened. In 8th grade, my remaining two friends ditched me for good. Now I’m starting 9th grade and I have no one. I’m done being optimistic. I’m done telling myself this year will be better than the last. I’ve given up. I think this is the loneliest I’ve ever felt.My sister-in-law, who had lived with me for years, and knows me well moved out recently and now I have no one to talk to. But the worst was when my adult sons grew up and left home because I loved cooking for my family. Now it‘s a struggle to feed myself. One son lives hours away and the other is busy with two jobs and two kids.I was on a vacation with friends in Europe and planned to spend my last week solo, mulling around and just enjoying the last of my vacation before starting a new job. In reality I spent 2 days walking around a city pretending to be just another tourist while internally I was more lost than ever before. On the third day I purchased a one-way ticket home (a week ahead of my original flight home) and spent 24 hours travelling embarrassed and anxious because I didn‘t know how I was going to explain my change in plans. To this day I have never told another person the real reason I came home early, that I couldn‘t handle the crushing reality of how alone I felt. Instead I lied and told everyone I was always the plan to finish my vacation at home. ""One evening I was stood up by my boyfriend and he didn‘t reply to my phone calls or my messages and my kids were with their father and I came home to an empty house and sat on the steps and realized the depth of the void inside me. I think I sat with my mouth gaping, incredulous at the profundity of my loneliness. It shattered the image I have of myself as independent emotionally and self-sufficient generally. It made me realize that I attempt to fill the hole with lovers but that I need to learn to fill it with self-love.Which sounds so cheesy, I know, and ultimately if we‘re social creatures we can‘t simply rely on ourselves for overcoming feelings of loneliness, no?I thought I would have figured this all out by 50!""I’ve been in a loving lesbian relationship for over a year but haven’t come out to my parents. So i’m having to spend Christmas this year away from her and her children, who are my world, to spend it with my family. It is so lonely to have this whole other amazing world that I can’t even talk about because of my parents close mindedness. I feel like I have to hide away all the best parts of my life and pretend to be an entirely different person. On a holiday that is supposed to be spent with loved ones and showing how much you care about them, i’m spending it with people who don’t even really know me. I’m a stranger in a room full of people i’ve known my entire life.I was at church. There are plenty of people who are my age, and after over a year of attending, I have not felt welcomed by them. No one spoke to me. I held back tears during service.I‘m single. Have no children even though I always wanted to be a mother. But I didn‘t feel I could do it alone. And I never found the right partner. Getting up in the morning and facing the day, and facing people – all married or divorced with children, or planning for a life like that. Knowing that I dont fit in. It takes courage every day to go to my job and out into the world, as myself – a single, childless woman. Im lucky enough to have finally found a job that I love, and my coworkers are very kind. I dont think they judge me. But on weekends and vacations I feel lost, weighed down by the stretches of unaccounted for time. When I go back to work after a weekend, I almost feel like Im recovering from an illness – slow and disorganized. Then the cycle starts all over again the following weekend. I hate holidays. I hate being a tag-along to someone elses celebration, hate being invited places out of pity, and also suffer when I spend a holiday by myself. Even when Im with my family, Im the odd one out. Watching way too much Netflix and Hulu over here in this particular apartment.When I found out I was pregnant I was so happy, but as my pregnancy progressed I realized, no one else is going to defend and fight for my child, no one else is going to take an interest in all his little milestones, no one else will be there through the monotony of the day. I never understood that motherhood could be so lonely until my second trimester.This year in general. I’ve felt a lot better than I have in passed years but sometimes I still feel a recurring feeling of isolation. I have friends but in an age of rising technology there seems to be a big disconnect from reality sometimes. I feel like my relationships have gotten significantly worse as technology continues to progress. There’s never any time to have conversations anymore. Everyone always has something to do or somewhere to be and I am here watching it through a tiny screen. Loneliness is a persistent feeling that resonates throughout the whole body and sometimes it feels like there is no way to stop it from consuming you.Hearing love songs. I physically can’t have sex so I can’t even do something as small as relating to a song. If I can’t have sex then I can’t have a boyfriend let alone a family. I wish I could see into my future and know if things will get better.I was recently separated from my child’s father. I had an empty house for the first time in over a year. It was the first time I was truly alone since the birth of my daughter.When I was in my third year of medical school. I had lived in that country for 4 yrs, I was 25 yrs old, I had never had a boyfriend, I wasn’t seeing anyone at that time. I had very rough days and I looked forward with desperation to Fridays. I would enjoy being on the crowded buses because of the human touch I would experience as others brushed by me. But when I got off the bus and climbed the steps to my room on hall, I realized I had nothing to do, no one to call and nothing I could have truly been looking forward to. I would cry myself to sleep each time and then repeat the whole thing again the following week.I once felt particularly lonely when I was home alone and thought about all the other people around the world that for a multitude of reasons felt similarly at that moment. I believe people around the world are fundamentally the same in that we just want to love and be loved. The recognition of the absence of love in my life that evening gave me a profound sense of loneliness.Most certainly after a serious break up. Sometimes there aren‘t perfect words to say or hear from the support of your family and friends. The best mechanism to this when I experience a romantic heartbreak is that I‘ve learned to depend on myself the most. Tons of self reflection and introspection helps me process my wounds and heal internally; which inevitably uplifts my external world as well.The night I walked out of the hospital alone, after hearing mum‘s diagnosis. I barely made it to my car, before I completely broke down. I sat there alone in the freezing cold and cried, until I had no tears left.Last night I played with a new band with mostly young people. They were making plans to go to the pub. I went home, drank wine and wrote emails. Most of these emails are friendly and thoughtful, but I never send them. Last night I wrote to my daughter who rarely calls unless she needs money. She‘s dealing with some serious mental health problems and I‘m pretty sure she got them from me.When my father and I got into an argument and he told me I wasn‘t worth 10 bucks.My freshman year of college is the loneliest I have ever been. I was a poor hispanic girl from a small suburb at a school for wealthy white kids from big cities, and I felt incredibly isolated. The school was notorious for being painfully cold and unwelcoming, but I didn‘t care. I wanted to be a writer and at the time, it seemed like the only way. I didn‘t make many friends, I was too depressed to function, and the friendships that I had spent my whole life building back home were crumbling before my eyes. The least lonely I ever felt at that college was at group therapy. It was a rough year.The day before I left and flew thousands of miles back home. When everything had failed. I took a picture of you sleeping on that lazy boy chair you loved. You looked so peaceful. I knew that would be the last photo I’d ever take of you and all the years of memories came rushing back. It was that moment I knew that I was alone. I’d lost you and you’d lost me.I met him via an online game called Trivia Crack. It’s similar to Trivial Pursuit. He said “hello” and I said “good game, shall we play again?” We continued to challenge each other for a while before I asked him where he was from, “Washington, D.C.” he said. He asked me, “Australia” I replied. He became intrigued as he hadn’t spoken to an Australian before. We spoke every day thereafter, exchanging numbers and Instagram handles. Before I knew it, I was head-over-heels for a man who lived over 11,000 miles away. I arrived in Washington, D.C. on the 31st of October 2016, 15 months after the first hello. I had just spent a month touring America, having met amazing people along the way and feeling accepted. The tour continued to New York however I departed and checked myself in at an AirBnB in Potomac, Maryland, recommended by the man of whom I had fallen for. No set plans had been made however he advised me that his mother was in hospital, he was stressed, it wasn’t good timing. I’d send a text message asking if he wanted to do this, wanted to do that though he never replied. I spent a lot of time in bed. I watched YouTube, which created an illusion of company. I dragged myself to Macy’s in the afternoon and browsed the department store alone, occasionally asking customer representatives where to locate an item, just to prove I wasn’t invisible, to feel alive for a moment. I took myself to the cinema and ate popcorn alone. I dined out alone. I drunk at a hotel bar alone. Occasionally we’d speak on the phone and I begged him to meet me, excuses were given. Sometimes I was given false hope, so I’d make an appointment at a beauty counter and have my make-up professionally applied, only to fall asleep at an ungodly hour having wasted my evening waiting to hear from him. I felt so utterly alone. I realised how alone I was when I continued to make appointments to have my make-up professionally applied, the beauty technician was polite and we’d share a conversation, general chit chat. Sometimes this was the only interaction I experienced all day. I felt worthless. I felt as if I was not worth his time nor effort. It was now the 18th of November 2016 and I spent the majority of my last day in a park watching squirrels and their behaviour. After a few final purchases and sights that had to be seen, the time had come to take myself to the airport. It was two hours before boarding and he had promised he would call so we could chat before I departed. One hour passed and I patiently waited, my anxiety level rose. I checked the time, thirty minutes until boarding and still nothing. I hid myself in a corner, called him and left a teary voice message. It was time to board and with "
