"a friend with my loneliness, if I was lonely I’d just think of him and it would all be okay. It was as simple as creating a fantasy and setting up the narrative. It became addicting that I ended up using it for years. The year that followed, I had a falling out with my friend and I had to leave the country. It was on the plane that I was most lonely as I looked back on the past 4 years of my life, all I saw was that I wasted my time on fantasies instead of making real bonds and the few friends I had managed to have, were now gone since I wasn’t planning on going back.The time I felt the most lonely was after my best friend had gotten married. I realized her now husband has replaced me as her best friend.I feel lonely for some reasons people think are stupid. I met a boy two summers ago, unfortunately we only had 9 days together but something happened to me that never has before. I’ve been to plenty of co-ed camps for longer than 9 days so why was this time different. We live about 600 miles away and I was prepared to try and make it work, until we could find a way to be together. He was not ready. He told me the only way for a relationship to work is to have physical connections, which I disagree with. He went on to randomly text me every 3 or so months which was torture. I felt like every time the hurt started to go away, he came back into my life. We would talk for a week or so and he would be gone again. I felt sad and alone then, but it wasn’t until this past summer September that I started to feel lonely. This boy went on to date a new girl, and watching it was painful, I attempted to delete him from my life, and friend zone him those weeks he tried to rekindle us for whatever reason, but he always comes back. On top of the sadness I’ve been struggling with for a years and a half, I’m also applying to college which has ruined my social life. I’ve grown apart from a lot of my friends this year, only adding to the nights by myself. They’ve started to get boyfriends and love interest of sorts and it’s a daily reminder of what I had, and what I lost. It sucks. I’m alone with my work and I know I’m working towards something but sometimes it’s hard to see the end of the tunnel. I don’t know when or if I’ll ever shake that boy out of my head but for the time being I’m attempting to distract myself with work. If you’ve gotten to this point, thank you for reading. I am writing this for myself because writing out my thoughts really helps me progress. I also believe there is somebody else out there with similar struggles and if you are that person just know you’re not alone. I don’t know if I am going up or downhill at this point but I will continue to persevere and hopefully you reading this will too.After I realised I never had a chance with this guy. Stupid, typical. So damn Bridget Jones. He was lovely, interesting, kind, generous. We had similar tastes in almost everything, but just enough difference. I’d been feeling things for him for a long time. He didn’t like me that way. Not that he betrayed it verbally. He’s not that kind of guy. I just sort of figured it out. But I knew. I just felt volatile, stupid. So damn stupid. And terribly isolated, let down. I’m not good enough - again. I’ll never find someone. I’ll end up a spinster. You know?Lately my husband has a new single female friend. He constantly texts with her and goes out with her and tells me it‘s just friends. I believe him (for now), but it doesn‘t take away the feeling of jealousy and loneliness when he‘s giving all his attention to this new person, instead of me. I want to be that person who he wants to talk to and spend time with, above all else. I have a lot of wonderful friends, but for my day to day - he‘s it.In elementary school. I’ve always been a loner and school has never been my strong suit. I tried so hard to fit in and be like everyone else but it’s hard when you have a learning disorder and no one knows about it. I just wanted to fit in.""One of my best friends had to move out of state to care for her very ill father. The husband of my other best friend was fired by a huge conglomerate a few months short of his retirement. He had worked for this company over 30 years. My best friend was trying to give emotional support to her husband and was worried about her husband and their retirement. My best friend continued working to support both of them.A few weeks later, my mother fell down her basement stairs and became unconscious at 10AM during a work day. She was taken to the nearby trauma center. My father and brother and sister were told that she would die of the massive bleeding inside her skull. The blood would put pressure on her breathing center of her brain and she would die. It was horrible and shocking and stunning. My husband of 30 years was at work when she fell. I called him & told him my mom had fallen down her basement stairs and was going to die that day, but he stayed at work anyway. She died at 3:45 pm. I called my husband again & he said he’d come to the hospital after he got off of work at 5 pm. It shook me to my core. My best friends were embroiled in their own worries. I felt I had no one to turn to and I felt so alone and lonely.....Then I went to my parents’ home and began calling their friends to tell them the sad news. I was empty.""I had just moved into a new apartment which I had discovered had a flea infestation. My new job was going terribly. I couldn’t sleep and was trying to hang up curtains and put together a bookshelf at 1 in the morning and I realized I couldn’t do it by myself, but I couldn’t call anyone. I also had no place to sleep besides my bed where fleas were jumping on me. Realizing no one was going to come and help me and knowing I needed help was one of my lowest moments. I just had to wait it out perched on a stool in my kitchen until the sun came up.I was with my family on New Year‘s Eve. When the clock hit 12:00, I was the only person in the room that didn‘t get a hug right after the ball dropped. I watched how everyone around me hugged, and I swear to God those were the longest few seconds of my life. I felt so lonely and pathetic, I realized I was nobody‘s person to hug on New Years.I was a teenager. Sitting alone at lunch realizing I had no friends to sit with me.When I was a small child. I was homeschooled and had no friends and a narcissistic mother. I would use my diary as a substitute for friendship, and I would write I love you to my diary because it felt like more of a companion and caregiver than my family did.I was 25 when I suddenly had the thought that I had shoved people away for far too long. I was still too afraid to change that.""I felt the most lonely during my birthdays. None of the people that I invite comes to my birthdays ever since I started having parties. I just end up eating every food served on the table and celebrating the ’special’ day with my family. I tried to think positively, but no matter how much they tell me that I should still be happy and feel lucky that I still have my family.. it’s still sad. During my 18th birthday, my dad lost his job (a week before my birthday) 18th birthdays here in the Philippines are supposed to be special and memorable for a girl because it’s her year of coming of age and I got nothing.. Most girls who turn 18 in our country gets gifts, fancy parties and guests.. and I got nothing.I shouldn’t really be feeling sad over this.. but.. I really did feel sad, even up until a month after my birthday.. And until now that I remember my 18th birthday, it still reminds me of the time when I was crying while praying, not because God gave me another year of life, but because I was so lonely.""As a grown-up, with wife, and kids, I went to Africa for work. I realized I was unbelievably far from everyone I knew, except my boss, who was literally two doors down in the hall, and with whom I shared nothing.I connected with a half-sibling late in life. I believe I made a decent effort to connect over the short years, but for whatever reason, the relationship was never there. I tried to keep this non-relationship going, thinking this is family; I need to keep this going, however much it is not working. I was invited over last Thanksgiving, to be generally ignored or looked upon like I was wasting their time. When I got back home, the I need to keep this going bell went off in my head, so I tried to find out what went wrong and see if things could be remedied. I received a lot of shady, nonsensical reasons for the behaviour, but what was worse was being told they wondered why I had no friends or boyfriend with whom to spend the holidays. I can‘t explain how lonely I felt then. Someone invited me over who didn‘t want me there and made no bones to show it, and then they decided to pull out a catalogue of imaginary people I should have that would somehow make me ... better? more normal? in their eyes. Now I have no contact with that sibling (my choice) and have even less people in my life now than ever.Recently my fianceé and I split up. It was a mutual thing because I knew she wasn’t ready for the commitment, but it’s still been hard. We are best friends and we still talk, but right now we’re distancing ourselves from each other for our own good and I just feel so alone. I wake up some nights and reach across the bed thinking she’s there and I wake up holding empty air. I miss her. I miss cuddling up with her and watching Netflix or reading next to each other before bed. I want my friend back but I don’t know what to do.Right now. My wife has a chronic illness that causes her daily pain. The loneliest feeling in the world is watching the person you love most in the world shake in pain and not being able to do anything. After the attack passes and she falls asleep, I’m too wired to sleep and cry alone on the couch.I get MRIs, imaging that can look at my brain and spinal cord, frequently. I sometimes need them a couple times per year in order to examine the progression that my Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has made. Every time I am in the MRI machine I feel completely alone. I feel vulnerable because behind the glass in the room right next door to mine, images are being flashed on a screen that show how diseased my insides are. I have lesions in my brain and all throughout my spinal cord...yet you wouldn‘t know it unless you saw those scans. My imaging takes at least an hour, sometimes longer. No one can be in the room with me during those tests. I go into the machine alone, tears in my eyes, panic in my heart about what new damage might show up in the results. I am reminded in that machine that I deal with MS alone. No matter what kind of support I have, ultimately I experience the disease by myself.I never felt so lonely when I realized that life is harder than I expected as I am getting older. I was so ready to have a family of my own until my ex-BF broke up with me. The sad thing was just after 2 years, I saw their Facebook recently of them getting married. I still don’t know what happened to us – I was so in love with him and I think it was maybe because he held against me the past diagnosis of my doctor that there is maybe a possibility that I may not have a child of my own (even though its not 100% sure). For you to just give up what we had and saying that the reason is there is no more spark is so damn lame. I did everything for him. He should’ve at least let me know earlier so that most of my years was not wasted waiting for him to ask me to marry him. I even professed how much I love to him: so much so that I can take a bullet for him but unfortunately, he did not feel the same way.I was a sophomore in college. I met my best friend from one of my freshman classes. We talked about anything and everything from UTIs to breakups to observations of our surroundings, came over to each other’s apartment and took care of the other when sick even though we were boroughs away. But then I got hooked on drugs and I became a completely different person. She tried taking care of me, but at some point I became too much to handle. We sat down and talked about it, and ended our friendship in the most civilized way. It broke my heart. I had never felt so alone. The next day it dawned on me that I no longer had anyone to talk to about petty things like “I’m pretty sure this girl in my finance class just straight up rolled out of bed. She’s in pizza-stained sweatpants.” Just thinking about it makes me tear up. Our friendship breakup changed me forever, for the better. I learned so much from her: I came out a kinder person from the experience. To this day I have not met anyone as great as she was.I felt most alone during my second year of law school. I was working full time in Boston at a large firm as a clerk for one of the partners. I commuted an hour home and then another hour to school. I took classes at night. All over social media, I saw my friends living their lives, enjoying their jobs, getting into serious relationships, moving into their own apartments. I felt stunted. While I had coworkers and classmates, I never saw them outside of work or school and rarely had anything in common with them. I have never been able to build a close circle of friends, particularly in the gay community, because I have never felt that I fit their acceptable definition of what a gay man is. It doesn’t help that I am overweight and I’m either viewed as a fetish or a disgusting slob. Feeling like I have no one to turn to who understands me has taken a real toll on not only my mental health but my physical health.""Christmas 2016. I was already feeling awful after the election of Trump, and I was dreading going home for the holidays knowing most of my family voted for him. But I had already taken time off from work and planned a visit to see my family but mostly my 89 year old mother.I flew in on Christmas day, fighting the crowds and depressed at not being with my husband back home. When I landed, I was planning to go to a sibling’s house and seeing everyone that day. When I called my sister, she told me they were all busy and had planned to get together a few days later.I really wish I would have just gone back to the airport and flown back home. Instead, I checked into my hotel but not before having my Christmas dinner: 2 hot dogs from a gas station.I cried myself to sleep and vowed NEVER to come home for Christmas ever again.""In the eighth grade, we took a class trip to Washington DC. We got to choose who we wanted to room with, but all three roommates had to write each other down on a form. I had thought I was going to be in a room with my two best friends, but the two of them wrote another girl in for their third and that girl wrote the two of them, leaving me with no one. I didn’t find out about this until the principal of my middle school brought me and one other student on stage in the cafeteria during the entire grade’s lunch period and announced to everyone that neither of us had a room and someone needed to claim us. I had no idea my friends hated me that much, and since that day I remain convinced that everyone hates me that much.My boyfriend got a really good job opportunity a couple hours away, and only comes home every other weekend. I’m trying to be supportive, but I hate that he’s not home every night. I’ve been resorting to drinking/drugs to keep myself busy. It’s ruining my life. I can’t tell him.I grew up in foster care. Constantly moving, constantly being passed over for adoption. Everyone wanted a baby. No one wanted a 15 year old girl. Than a family wanted me. I lived with them till I was 19. I came out as gay and then they pulled the adoption and kicked me out for being gay. I felt so alone. Like life wasn’t worth living if I had nobody. I started drinking, doing drugs to escape the feeling of being lonely. Even to this day it follows.The past few years, I have succeeded in my goal of working in the field of a big organization in international development, something I’ve always dreamt of since I was a teenager. I’ve been fortunate to be able to work in some amazing places that others would normally never see. But it has taken a toll on my personal life. As I age, all my peers find significant others. The men in the missions, who want to have affairs with you, have wives who raise their children and keep their family homes. My country is so expensive, my savings are all I have, but I’m not even halfway able to afford a mortgage alone on my own after 7 years. I don’t even know if I want to live there either. I only have one family member, my mother, after my brother was killed in a car accident when he was 18.""I grew up in a small abusive family. My family told me things like “don’t get too friendly: at Christmas people will expect Christmas presents.” I think that the goal was to isolate me and my sisters so the abusive behaviors could be hidden. Consequently, I didn’t have the best social skills.I got older and got tired of being secretive and miserable. To my surprise, when I got a little more open, some people (not all) turned out to be sympathetic. I hadn’t known that I came off as cold: I was trying to be professional. But I still felt lonely sometimes. I got married to a musician who seemed to be a good match. It was as if our motto was “you and me against the world.”Part of that “you and me against the world” turned out to be a kind of grooming by my husband. There was this great enveloping narrative that he was this great musician, he had never gotten what he deserved career-wise, his ex-wife was a conniving &*&, and with my help he was going to “make it.”That should have been my clue right there. We got along—as long as I kept in mind that my life’s work is supposed to be “figuring out how to make HIM successful”. One day I woke up and realized that I could not fix this person. Starting in the morning, along with a cup of coffee, I get a full dose of his negativity—this person won’t “give him a job,” and that person won’t acknowledge what a great musician he is. And that I am selfish for not dropping my exhausting work schedule to stop and work on music with him. (Because that makes sense—stop my paid work to work on music that hasn’t paid much in the many many years we have been together.)Amy Tan (the author) recently spoke on Fresh Air (a radio program) about her mother (who she describes as possibly borderline). She pointed out her mother was only happy when they were both complaining about the ills of the world (real or imagined). Similarly, I am only on my husband’s good side when I agree with him about all the wrongs he feels he faces. He rarely sees positives; he lives in a world of perpetual grievance.I work from home now. He is home all the time. He spends all day trying to get me to agree with his narrative of the world. It’s exhausting, it’s stifling, and I feel I can never have my own head space. And it’s lonely.""I‘m on winter break from college right now, and in the last couple days my parents have been questioning me about my relationship with my boyfriend and insisting that I don‘t care about their feelings. Some of their old ideas make me feel very uncomfortable, and I‘m finding communication with them extremely difficult because they get fixed on negative ideas about me. Also I think they read my journal secretly, and this makes me furious. Problems with my parents make me feel very lonely, and the reverse culture shock Ive felt ever since I came back to China is making it worse. The only person I can really talk to is my boyfriend, but hes physically so far away.A year ago, my girlfriend who was the only person I was 100% honest with left me for another guy. We were living together so my place got a lot quieter. Everyone around me tells me to move on. I’m trying but it’s really hard to meet new people. I am a healthcare professional and an instructor and I help people overcome their mental health obstacles. The new people I meet are in need of my help or students. I cannot date these people ethically. It’s ironic that I help others overcome their loneliness and obstacles but I cannot help myself. To add to the problem, I am shy and a rare personality type: INFJ. As a male INFJ, some say I make up less than 1% of the population. There is loneliness in not having people understand me as a person. I have so much to give but I just keep it all to myself and focus on my job. I’m very good at it as I am one of the youngest instructors hired by my post-secondary institution. I just wish that my job was not the only thing I have. At my job, I’m constantly working with people but I’ll never be able to form anything more than a therapeutic relationship with them. It’s like being in loneliness hell sometimes.I was dating someone who was emotionally abusive to me. I had been trying to fix things between us and sent him a text that angered him instead. He responded to it by calling me an idiot and telling me to fuck off. I received those texts when I was grocery shopping. I distinctly remember standing in front of the tomatoes reading these harsh, cruel words and feeling so hurt and alone that I just started to cry. It wasn’t the actions of the man I cared about that made me lonely but it was the fact that I could stand in a busy grocery store and openly cry and not have one single person ask me if I was okay.The seclusion of ourselves. We all intensify our loneliness with technology. Everyone has some type of loneliness is their life including myself. But we all intensify that feeling when we go on our phones instead of talking to each other or worrying about how many likes or comments you get on a picture instead of connecting to the people who are with you. I’m not blaming people in general and I know this isn’t everyone’s case, but the majority of us nowadays intensify our own loneliness instead of appreciating what’s in front of us. Never forget to look up once in a while and talk to someone instead of worrying about who’s looking at your social media.Fifty Novembers ago, I was roused to consciousness in the emergency ward at The Toronto Western Hospital by nurses and young doctors asking me questions that I had no patience for responding, my head was exploding with dangerous pain! Eventually I was placed in an observation ward while specialists determined how best to treat my injury, I was completely paralyzed on the left side of my body, even my face was affected. During the many months that I was hospitalized, family and friends even strangers would visit and chat with me but facing an uncertain future, I understood that my old life was gone forever and I needed to discover new roads. I felt alone and abandoned by life! My head injury was painful and I suffered ridiculous nightmares when I would hallucinate screaming crazily, waking my wardmates. Many patients admitted to observation wards in the 1960s were waiting for the end of their stay on the planet, I witnessed more than a few gentlemen that I chatted with closing their eyes forever. On one occasion a head nurse asked if the deaths bothered me, I do not recall answering. I was crying, perhaps for myself! Life doesn’t end when we lose the thrill and joy of doing things we love, but the process to heal and rejoin the community is a slow tedious process. I am no longer alone or feel lonely but somehow it took 20 years for people to feel comfortable around me again. Or perhaps it took that same period for me to be comfortable with myself again.I think that I am currently experiencing the loneliest point in my life. After being out of school for three years I decided to go back to school for my masters. I got into a great school in the UK with two scholarships that covered almost all of my tuition, so I decided to go. I left my friends, family, pets, and my live-in boyfriend of four years. I went from talking about getting engaged and buying a house to living alone in a dorm on the other side of the world. This is the first time I’ve ever lived alone, and I am doing it in a country that isn’t my own. Living abroad seems so glamorous, but it has been the loneliest and hardest thing I’ve ever done. I always will stand out because of my accent, and I will never truly fit in here no matter how much I want to.Being a homosexual in the south, especially now, never has been easy and it never does get truly better. Four months ago my job I had worked at for two years let me go, the reason they gave me was because I was making the male employees uneasy...I was in a pool of seven women. I didn’t understand but I cleaned out my desk and left. Then my work friends became my friends, then my acquaintances, then poof – they were gone. Fast forward 4 months later, the coffee shop is a fine job while I’m trying to get a business loan going to open my own business, but it’s not full time and the days I’m home and my partner is out working his “big boy” job, everyone’s gone. Everyone. If it wasn’t for the cat this big empty house would literally be my prison. But I will make it through. We all will.When I put my puppy to sleep, me & My bestfriend are in a fight""Before I found recovery from my eating disorder, I was living in someone‘s basement, away from home for the first time. I was 19. My eating disorder was spiralling out of control – I couldn‘t stop eating and had just started making myself throw up. I had tried seeing a psychologist for help, but felt spoken down to and did not want to see her again. I didn‘t know where else to turn for help.I couldn‘t understand why I couldn‘t stop eating, it was torture. I didn‘t want to be eating – my jaws hurt, I was gaining weight so quickly I had stretch marks, I was eating food out of the garbage and stealing from my roommates. And yet I presented the image of perfection to all of my coworkers. I was thin, athletic, outgoing...no one would have guessed what I was doing behind closed doors.One night, I felt so alone and was so desperate to stop eating, I took scissors out of the drawer and tried to cut myself – I thought if someone saw scars on my forearms, someone would notice that I needed help.Luckily, I stopped before the scissors pierced my skin, and soon after, I found help with twelve-step recovery groups for compulsive eating/bulimia/anorexia. It saved my life, and those groups continue to save my life each day.""My fiancé left me a few years ago on Valentine’s Day, after finding out I had cancer. Even through I’m handsome and kind and know a ton of people, I have no friends and spent Christmas Day for the third year in a row alone in my studio apartment. I thought things would get better, but they don’t in spite of my trying. I go to the grocery store a lot now just so I can talk to another person. My family are Mormon and ostracized me twenty years ago, and I’ve never found a replacement family. I love the stories here, it made me feel loved simply by knowing there are others like me.""There have been many. Most often I‘ve been surrounded by people, and yet felt completely and utterly alone. Some of the loneliest times of my life were on tour with my band.For three years I was the bass player in a moderately successful pop punk band. We traveled the country, and later the world, and though I was surrounded by people all the time (band mates, other bands, people‘s houses we stayed at, fans / audience) I felt completely alone.The other members of the band were very politically minded, socially conscious folks who thought very highly of themselves in terms of awareness, acceptance, and compassion not to mention thinking themselves champions of the underdog and the oppressed. Despite all of their rhetoric when it came down to it they simply could not, or would not, accept me and the communication / attention / emotional issues that being on the spectrum present. They were awful to me.I was separated from my dog, one of the only beings I‘ve ever felt truly connected to, my friends, and my work (routine keeps me grounded and functioning). Eventually I left that band, but the experience has stayed with me all these years later. I have a hard time trusting people who say they are my friends that they‘re not going to talk behind my back, or lash out at me when I do something neuro-atypical. It’s very hard for me to get close to people and this experience made that much harder still. There were good things about that time in my life; I felt like I had friends, I felt like I belonged, I felt like I had a giant nationwide community, and there were fun times. I worry that I‘ll never feel any of those things again, even though feeling them the first time almost ruined me.After that experience I fell into a deep depression that eventually led to me becoming a heroin addict for the next six years on and off, until the final two years were just on and I almost died. I‘m clean now, but I know how slippery that slope is and how easy it is to fall down. I feel lonely about that too, I miss heroin sometimes and the ease and comfort it gave me that nothing else in my life ever has.So many times; there is no most lonely. If there were, I guess the most lonely would be anytime that I focus on that feeling. Immediately, the floor goes out from under me and I am in free fall; no one to catch me; no one to acknowledge my existence. I am even alone when at family gatherings. They have their familiar conversations; I don‘t fit in, so I sit quietly and don‘t even listen. None of them talk about topics that interest me. Odd man out; always the odd man out. That‘s me.""I go to a pretty conservative Christian school – and as a Asian lesbian, it‘s really hard to get through the day, listening to the homophobic and racist comments I hear all the time. The friends I make at school all have turned out to be horrible in some form; either letting people bully minorities and laughing at it, or doing something absolutely horrible to someone else. I realised that I‘ve been bullied since Year 7 for being different, even though Ive been convinced that I was only overreacting.The only true friends are the ones Ive made through the internet... but they have their own lives, and I cant ask them to dedicate every second of the day to me, especially living in different time zones. Whenever Im alone, after they all go to sleep... it really hits me, how lonely I really am. Its hard to get through the day when the school tries to cut me off from them, and my parents dont know about them, because Im scared theyll try to cut me off as well.""I was at a party in college. I only knew one person and felt like I was following her around like a lost puppy. I am terrible at starting conversations and left very shortly after arriving. I went home by myself and cried for the good time I could have had.The time I felt the most lonely was when I decided to have an abortion. I was in an abusive relationship and knew that having a baby in that environment would be detrimental. My family talked me into having the abortion, but I was so conflicted as all I’d ever wanted in life was to be a mother. Here I was with the opportunity, and was giving it up. I felt like no one understood what I was experiencing, and because abortion is such a polarizing subject, I didn’t feel safe opening up to people about it. I had to go through the day with extreme emotional anguish and pretend I felt okay. Even though this took place years ago, there are still days where I feel alone when I think about it because I don’t think anyone will be able to relate to me.I was standing on the golden gate bridge. There were seals playing in the surf. The wind was blowing. And humanity just kept walking by.I was the short fat kid that was the last to be picked for dodgeball... You want to laugh, I‘m still short and but now add bald to that list. Oh, it‘s been loads of fun. Anyway, I remember it was cold in November but there was no snow in the ground yet. I don‘t know why but I‘d gone around the where the teachers parked their cars. Students werent allowed there. I sat there between two cars and started crying. I remember wishing I could go somewhere else. Be in a place where people were kind. Still feel that way.I’ve felt lonely from birth, like something was always missing. I have always been shy too. I don’t relate well with people my age. Never have. The teens were the worst. It was a struggle to fit in and I didn’t want to. As an adult I feel other again where I live. No one is like me, acts like me, thinks as I do. It’s a weird feeling and a nagging struggle.At a party. We were arriving late because she consistently runs late. At first I thought I could help her be on time, then it became apparent to me that this is purposeful. Running late always set a tense"
