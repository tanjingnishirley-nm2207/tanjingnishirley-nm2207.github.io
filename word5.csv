"mood. We came in frustrated, irritable. Then put on a happy face. I spent the night on the other side of the room trying to smile. It was that night I simply realized we don‘t like each other. For me this is loneliness.I used to volunteer at a camp every summer, and I used to love it. This past summer, for the first time in 6 or 7 years, I felt the isolating effects of my deteriorating hearing loss and speech capabilities. I made ZERO new friends that week and if anything, lost touch with old friends. This was a camp I had always felt safe at due to the inherent inclusive nature of everyone involved, but this year was different. I felt so cast aside by the very people I thought I could trust to not do that, I ended up keeping to myself and counting down the days until the week was over. All I wanted to do was sit alone in my home because I thought that would spare everyone else from having to listen to me talk. There is no sense of isolation like feeling unable to communicate with those around you.I went to a conference several states away from home a few years ago, to schmooze with some folks from a school where I wanted to apply to be a graduate student. There was a big social gathering the first night of the conference, and the people I was trying to schmooze with didn‘t arrive until about an hour and a half after it started. In a room with a couple hundred people, I was more desolately alone than I‘ve felt since I was about twelve years old. The conference was a week long, and even though I had people to tag along with much of the time, after finally finding them, I felt like a third, fifth, seventh wheel, and every night I went back to my room and cried.The loneliest I feel is when I am at work as a resident physician in a large Canadian hospital. I stay awake for 26 to 28 hours overnight caring for my patients who believe doctors cannot do their jobs because of what they hear on TV and being berated and abused by my supervisors and the nurses. This is common amongst all medical teaching institutions in the country. I and many of my peers are overwhelmed; several have problems with addictions, and many express thoughts of suicide. One of my loneliest moments was when somebody asked me why I kept talking to them about how strenuous work was. I realised that while we all dealt with deep depression, the ones who were doing well had loved ones who cared to talk to about their feelings. The rest of us are dying in a system that uses brute force and abuse to teach us how to save a life, but we will never be able to talk about it openly for fear that we will lose our jobs and then subsequently our lives, because it is all we have now.""Saturday evening I took my children to a parade downtown. I had been consumed by my children and other family for a good part of the day so I hadn‘t had time to even stop and think. As I am standing on the parade route watching the floats pass by, the loneliness hit. I was surrounded by literally thousands of people including three that I love most in the world but I had to hold back tears. In that moment, while the kids were still and the hustle and bustle of the day had settled, I realized that the lingering feeling, the ache in my chest was there. It was as if the parade had slowed down to a crawl and all of the voices around me had hit the slow motion button.I was present but I wasn‘t.I was thinking about the life I left with my children‘s father and about the unknown life in front of me. I never realized how lonely raising children would be.In that moment I looked around at couples and ached for what they had. I want someone to be by my side and love me. The reality that I live in wonders if I will ever find someone who will want to be part of my crazy life. Want to grow a relationship with someone who has so much on their plate.""Never I went to the theater alone to see a movie. On the screen a man was sitting in a restaurant alone looking sad. From behind me a man says pathetic. I thought to myself: the guy in the movie is me. Am I pathetic?At the beginning of high school I had friends and by the end I had none. The people I thought were my friends did not turn out to be my friends and I spent most of my days being verbally abused by some of them. I felt really powerless and I pretended to not care but it really got the best of me. At home there were things going on with my family and since the ones I thought I could open up to betrayed me I became more and more enclosed. I still find it really hard to share anything with anyone, I am really afraid.I was sitting at the dinner table eating by myself after making Sunday dinner. No one came when I called. I ate by myself.""Six months ago a colleague of mine became my manager. In essence, he refused to provide feedback or oversight for any of my projects and began a campaign of undermining my reputation at work. As our office had thin walls, I could hear much of his conversations with colleagues that would basically consist of him convincing people who I thought were friends and confidants that I was incompetent and responsible for what were ostensibly his shortcomings.It hurt so badly to watch these relationships crumble... but more than anything it was the most lonely moment in my life because in that time I realized that one well-situated person can sully the waters of thousands of hours of authenticity. In the end, I left that job. It has been hard trying keep in touch with people who refuse to keep plans or see you. I still wonder what exactly I did or said.. As an adult, I cannot reconcile how painful it is to watch people you love, trust, and respect be so fickle and so disingenuous. I still struggle daily with the loss of so many friends in such a short time.""The loneliest I felt was when my roommate moved out of our apartment in the middle of the semester. At first I loved the solitude of it all, relishing the newfound freedoms I had been granted (goodbye pants!) Eventually, I started to miss the feeling of being noticed and acknowledged by others every day. Eventually, it started to feel like the world was beginning to forget I was there.When I was in primary school, nobody wanted to be friends with me, because I am autistic and struggled with holding conversation. Everyone thought I was weird and made fun of me. Kids overestimate their ability to whisper.Once I had a rough day at work. I was supposed to hang out with friends after and was really looking forward to it. When I got there, they told me that I was too upset to be around them and kicked me out of their apartment. All I wanted was some support.""At the age of 36, I finally realized that I was depressed and probably been for a very long time. I fell apart emotionally, sought out treatment, and after several years I was feeling better about myself (this gave me the courage to get out of an abusive marriage along with my three children). When I was in hospital for my depression my mother visited and asked me “how could you do this to me?”None of my siblings visited, I had no close friends so no friends visited either. I was ashamed and felt lesser than... I’m sounding melodramatic, the truth is I always feel lonely. ALWAYS. My life has a great deal of wonderful moments. I remarried a lovely, kind man, I have grandchildren. I have a comfortable lifestyle. Yet, I feel utterly alone.""When I won my first Judo Tournament at 28, I told my friends about my 1st place victory that evening at a restaurant we all met up that evening. Everyone stared at me like I didn’t belong at that table. I was surrounded by people and I just felt so alone and defeated. I didn’t feel welcomed the whole time and just picked at the food we ordered. I began to not wanting to do Judo, a sport I loved dearly, after that event because I felt alone for liking things that none of my coworkers, friends, and family had in common. Being a individual and yourself was casting a aura around me which people wanted to avoid. I felt that this loneliness was of my own making and I needed to like things that others liked so I can be included and not so lonely. I wanted to be normal. Being normal and trying to fit in with my friends only made me feel more lonely. Allowing myself to accept my differences is what allows me to be at peace with this feeling. Fitting in with the popular crowd is just not something I wanted to do but the conventions of modern society wants me to do. It’s not normal for someone to not go on a coffee date with friends because you want to train for 2 hours on Judo moves they been thinking about for a week with people who understand. It’s not normal to avoid parties because you have a date with a couch and a book you want to finish up. When my loneliness hits me, it is just a reminder that I am just doing what I can in a society that doesn’t agree with everything that I do. It’s made everything I do worthwhile and reminds me that while not everyone will agree with my life, I always have someone who gets my choices and I do the same for them.I was the only person in my 9th grade health class who believed in abstinence. Everyone thought I was a freak. I was completely isolated from everyone and no one wanted to talk to me. I never had a partner in gym class and I’d always do my work alone. It hurt like hell. I was made to feel worthless only because I wanted to save myself.There’s never been one time where I’ve felt the most lonely. It’s rather a constant thing that I feel everyday. I have friends and family I can count on for support but no one with whom I can connect or share anything. I’ve been a journalist for about 3 years now and have covered mostly crime and war. I’ve seen enough death, bloodshed and devastation to last a lifetime, and I don’t really know anyone with whom I can relate to anymore. Veterans have a lot of support groups, mental health access and so on. But journalists make little money and have no support. The images of bloodied corpses, of people screaming and terrified for their life, of children staring at dead bodies, of soldiers with shrapnel in their chest bleeding profusely, of trying to sleep when bombs are dropping around me, are constantly with me no matter how hard I try to forget. The only time I can connect with people are when I’m in these arenas, but it’s always fleeting and then they’re out of my life and all I’m left with is more trauma.""A while ago, in the early summer, I had fallen incredibly in love with someone despite the fact that neither of us were quite ready for a relationship. When we returned to school in the fall I was faced with the prospects that they were an incredibly outgoing and loving person, something which scared and overwhelmed me (as a quiet and very shy person). When I went to them to tell them about my fears, it scared them. It scared them that I am someone with mental health issues and am someone that doesn’t like themselves are as a person. To this point, this person had only seen me in 1-on-1 situations where I am much more carefree and fun. Though I can only guess their thoughts, I imagine the prospects of having to deal with me as a burden was too much for them and they told me that we couldn’t continue to be together.I spent 2 days at home, periodically sitting in the bottom of the shower or lying on the floor, debating suicide. To be told that your mental health is a burden to others is not easy to hear. On the 3rd day, out of nothing more than obligation, I went to work. There I had a heart-to-heart with a coworker I had never really connected with. She managed to rally the other employees to give me a longer break and bought me ice cream and took me out for beer after work. I understand that not everyone is lucky enough to find someone to pull them out of the bottom when they need it the most. But I remain eternally grateful.""""Being admirably independent is a curse. It translates that people just naturally assume that you’ll be okay on your own. While there is truth within that notion, they forget that when we ask for help, it’s truly a moment that we need help. I asked for assistance to move and each person dismissed me you’ll be fine on your own, I’m sure you can handle it yourself, you’re so organized, you don’t need extra help. On the day I moved into my new townhouse, I bawled on my doorstep. I felt so alone and abandoned.Being admirably independent also means feeling achingly alone.""""I was a new mom and my daughter’s witching hour was at 3 AM. This time of day was the most lonely for me and the first time I truly felt the depth of how lonely parenthood would end up being for me. I would stand in front of the window looking out over the neighbourhood (while feeding the babe) and I would think about how everyone was sleeping (including my significant other) and I felt like I was the only one awake feeling my wretched feelings. To keep me company, I would keep the TV in the bedroom on. I would watched Real Housewives and Paradise Hotel re-runs. To this day turning the TV on helps me feel less lonely and reduces my anxiety – it has become a source of comfort for me.I have resented my daughter and being a parent – before this I never felt this degree of isolation. I suffered from postpartum depression for nearly 8 years after she was born and that is an isolating experience because after a while people don’t want to help you deal with it anymore – they become tired and push you away. Thankfully, I am feeling less depressed. As she grows older and becomes someone that I can relate with parenting becomes less of a chore. I think all of my feelings stem from the fact that I never wanted children and now I am stuck with the duty of being responsible for another human life – and my loneliness is borne out of being dislocated from what I truly wanted for myself. I love my daughter and she is a beautiful and amazing soul and I do my best to be the best that I can be, but it’s not enough, for me.""My first two months in my current city. I had just moved here and didn’t know a single soul. I had a tiny basement apartment where I lived alone, and everyone I loved (including my wonderful boyfriend) was a 3 hour flight away.Sitting on the playground sometime before I was ten. I would read under the trees, or just stare out and watch the other kids playing. I didn’t understand them, their unadulterated joy just from from screaming and running. I was such a serious child, I thought that I was above that. I was taught that being silly and childlike was a thing to be ashamed of, that being quiet and smart was valued more in a person. I had a vivid imagination, one that went wild into fantasy or my potential future life. But that didn’t extend past dreaming and writing stories. I was too afraid of being embarrassed by the other children, being made fun of or singled out for something I did. I still can’t get over that feeling to this day, that I’m constantly being evaluated and judged. It makes for a lonely world – you have to be able to stomach vulnerability to conquer loneliness.Opening up my heart to another man two years after my divorce only to be rejected and betrayed again. I cried everyday for about a year. I thought I‘d never recover. My husband was the only man I‘d ever been with so this was risky business for me. It took all the courage within me to even meet this man for coffee. I look back now and see him for what he is but that experience has crippled me. I will never trust or risk my heart again. It would take Superman cape and all to get me to risk my heart. I‘m doomed to grow old and die alone. All this stupid technology that “connects” us and yet look at the loneliness.I was 5 years old when I moved with my Mom from Nakhon Sawan, Thailand to Berlin. Before that I normally lived with my auntie and my grandmother. We sleep and eat together everyday and by night I used to sleep with my grandmother. So I was never alone somehow. My family is complicated. My Mom couldn‘t look after me because she has to work so I never saw her. And when we move to Berlin everything changed. Well, my Mom was a really strict and impatient person. It was hard to lived with her. I had no friends, couldn‘t speak german and I couldn‘t understand why I have to sleep alone. This was the time when I feel really lonely in a big city.The loneliest I felt was when I heard that I needed an emergency surgery, and I had no one to accompany me to the hospital. I went through that phase with the help of spiritual company, and I’m forever grateful to the imaginary friend we can all call upon at times.""A few years ago, I went up to my cottage with my sister and a couple of her friends. On Sunday they left to head home ahead of my sister and I, so we went for a quick fishing trip in the morning, with plans to drive home that afternoon. On the trip, she started asking me probing questions about my my mental and physical health. We weren’t really on that level of sharing, and I was in counselling already to help define boundaries between me and my family as their impact on me was continuously negative. This incident proved, again, to be exactly that. I tried to answer her questions with a certain restriction, as I wasn’t game to share too much - she previously hadn’t treated my experience and feelings with a level of respect that I appreciated. This seemed to antagonize her, and she pressed really hard for info. Then asking why we can’t get along. Why are we not better sisters? I had to let her know I didn’t trust her with my stuff. That I’ve been through a trauma in my childhood, that she doesn’t accept or understand, and I still deal with PTSD-like symptoms to this day that she doesn’t acknowledge. She asked if I had been diagnosed, and pressed to see if my counselling was appropriate to deal with my issues. I felt very judged and triggered by her questions, she again didn’t show the concern for me that I felt a sister should show. It was clinical and cold. It seemed to come from the doubt she had about my experience. So I called her out on that, and got angry, eventually lashing out.My reaction was exaggerated and extreme. It came from a deeply hurt place in me, that perpetually feels the divide between me and my family and longs for more care and consideration from them. She lashed back, and it just didn’t de-escalate. Over 4 hours we fought as we packed up the cottage. Eventually I paid $40 for a cab to take me to the bus station in town. Then $70 for a bus ticket home, leaving her at the cottage to drive home solo. I fended off my dad in a follow-up call, where he accused me of being the problem, again.I sat on a pre-made floating dock from a store near the bus stop, crying as I defended myself, and all the information I shared with my sister. I answered the phone thinking he might be concerned for me. Maybe he was, but it’s not what came through. This was the most decisive move I’ve made against my family, in support of myself. It’s also the first time I very physically felt the divide. It is a deep wound, to be emotionally estranged from your family out of self-preservation. Like every time I am feeling alone and need support, and think maybe I’ll call home. I have to point to the wound and remind myself of the hurt. Cause if I don’t they’ll do it again, and I’m the one who suffers. So alone is an everyday feeling. I felt it the most that day, but the wound is always with me.""I went to a party with my ex best-friend, who had not talked to me in weeks because she was too consumed with her boyfriend. She didn’t even talk to me, put in effort or try to be there for me.My parents left the US to go back to Turkey in 2013. I was in my senior year of university and I had just moved in with my friend and her family. There were about 8-10 of us there each day but I felt more alone than ever. I did not know who I was without the guidance of my parents. I was raised in a Muslim household where you go from your father’s house to the house of your spouse...except I was not married and did not plan to marry anytime soon, nor did I have any real prospects. I gained weight, stopped taking care of myself, cried myself to sleep nearly every night, and lost my friend/roommate due to my insecurities. It took me a long time to figure out my own path, but I have and I am not defined by anyone else but me today. I do not fear being alone anymore because I am all that I will ever need. When I shifted my perspective the universe brought in more people into my life, people who genuinely care and I am forever thankful. I would not be the person I am right now if it was not for the excruciating lonely phase I experienced from 2013-2015. I still remember that girl and I honor her struggle by sitting in empty parking lots for a few hours at a time (a favorite past-time of mine when I had no friends or family) here and there.Being an entrepreneur is really tough and very lonely. The buck stops with you and you have to be on top of everything all the time. In the early years there is no revenue so you have to get by on very little. And the hardest part is when times are tough, you doubt whether what you are doing is going to work, but you can‘t tell anyone how you really feel. In tech startups, founders are 90% men who bluff their way along and never admit that everything isnt great. No one ever says things suck. I understand a little why a friend committed suicide. There was no one he could share what was really going on in his life. Im at a point with my business where Im running out of energy and cant get motivated to work 24/7. Id like to share my real challenges with someone but there is no one. This makes it very lonely.""I felt most lonely when I was out having drinks with my friends and they started talking about their relationships and sex lives. I couldn’t relate because I have always been single and never had sex. I started to wonder if I’m missing out by not dating or ’putting myself out there’. I also think what if I never find a partner and remain forever alone. I never think about it too much until I’m reminded by similar conversations.""My parents fight a lot. Belonging to a culture where divorce is heavily frowned upon, all I hear some days are loud yelling, crying, and weeks after that: stony silence. It wrecks me. My sister, half my age, I try to shield her from them. Close the door. Put music on.I know they love me. I know they don’t love each other.Days like this I feel lonely. I count down the days until I can leave, count down the days until my sister is left alone with people that hate each other, but love her. They don’t care.I feel lonely a lot.""To understand my story, it’s important to understand its origin. My wife passed when I was 31 years old. Leaving me with a 4 and 2 year old. Raising them became my sole purpose in life. Now they are both away in college I struggle to find and understand my purpose in life. I listen to couples espouse the joys of empty nesting but for me it’s just a dark hole of nothingness every day after work. I work 11 hours a day simply because I have nothing better to do. There’s got to be a better way.The most lonely I’ve felt is when I found out about my anxiety, and it just made me feel crazy, and every time someone looks at me, I tell myself that they think I’m crazy too.This year I’ve felt both very lonely and very connected. I started university, which began with me pretending I didn’t mind sitting alone when I ate lunch and ended with a best friend and a bunch of other wonderful people who genuinely care about my wellbeing. I still feel lonely when I realise I can’t tell them how much I worry about my mother and her recent alcoholism, though. Sometimes I get home and she’ll be drunk and I’ll feel so guilty for leaving her alone. I keep finding bottles and glasses of vodka stashed away and I get so paranoid that I’m disrespecting her boundaries in trying to find the alcohol she’s hiding from me. The other day she stole alcohol that was a present for my friend and lied about it. She’s not a bad person and she’s been a wonderful mother to me. I think this makes it harder; I’ve trusted her completely my whole life and now whenever I see her I feel nothing but paranoia and isolation. I’m the loneliest I’ve ever been.Last week. I got broken up with by someone I had opened up to and talked about a future with, and after the break up I went into a depressed spiral of not eating and not talking to people and just wallowing. Realising that people’s lives just go on while yours is crumbling, and that people can just not notice, is something terribly isolating. But once I extended my hand and said I need help please, I realised how many people care, they just can’t read minds.December 17th 2017, my girlfriend went to the United States to help her father, who was going through a medical treatment. After the flight, she spent days without contacting me. It was only when I tried to reach her, I found out she had cancelled her emails and changed her phone number. To this day, I still check my phone and emails every hour, waiting for an answer.I feel most lonely RIGHT NOW realizing that my adult daughters don’t care what I do or where I go (my grandchildren are getting bigger and do not need me like they used to) and my husband is mentally talking himself into being old at 74, and I now have to face the truth that he never cared about me and does not have the ability to love me or listen to my needs. My son died at 30 and the pain will never go away (after 9 years) so that is sitting inside my stomach and my family will not discuss it with me (a mother who is crying for her child). I am trying to understand what I did wrong in my life (and my children’s lives) that they are so callous as not to even listen to their mother’s cry for help. I guess I never showed them my vulnerability before so this situation is not something they know how to deal with. I was always there for them and still am. They are treating me now like a schmatta or rag that they can now either throw away or do not need any more (unless a crisis arises). I don’t really have good close friends who might care and acquaintances don’t really give a damn. I don’t seem to have interests that I can pursue and I feel much younger than my age and I haven’t met too many women my age that don’t talk about their ailments or operations. I am a younger person at heart that feels comfortable talking to mothers who have younger children but I am still 73 years old. Our finances are limited so I cannot pursue my only passion right now of fixing up my house so that I can feel refreshed and, of course, my husband doesn’t care where he lives. All he cares about is that I feed him and not give him stress. I don’t need anti-depressants (which would make my physical being a basket case) I JUST NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO, BE COMPASSIONATE TOWARDS ME AND NOT JUDGE ME FOR FEELING THIS WAY. I have given up on my psychologist because after a while, they don’t want to hear everyday whining, they eventually want to see results. I guess I should look for another psychologist but that’s just the way my life is going. Loneliness is eating me up alive.When I got to Canada and left my abusive parents’ home. Had no friends, not even casual ones, barely making rent and my friends back home with the time difference couldn’t match up. Felt like I was sinking everyday without anyone to call out for.Some nights when my depression gets bad, I badly need someone to talk to, and the first time I had a full on wave of depression was the first time I realized I had no one to talk to about it. No one I knew was I comfortable to share it with, and my parents were definitely out of the picture. I was forced to internalize it, and the next day when I went to school I expected people to notice that I was not alright, and that I needed someone to talk to and didn’t know who to reach out to. No one noticed. I realized then that it didn’t matter how I felt on the inside and how well I knew myself if everyone I know sees me as a bright and happy girl. If I’m the only person that actually knows who I am, how does anyone really know me at all? Are we really the people we know ourselves to be if everyone else has a different image of us? Do I exist outside of their main image of me?When two of my dearest friends got married and I was in the wedding party. My SO couldn’t be there and I didn’t know many of the other people attending. I love to dance, loved the music... but no one was dancing with me, no matter how much I tried to dance and just let go. So I left the wedding tent and stood outside in a field under the stars, hearing the far away music and dancing by myself because that was the only place I could dance.When I found out that my partner of 20+ years had cheated on me with multiple women over the years while coming home to me every day pretending that all was well. Incredible sadness and loneliness that lingers even though we are now separated.""The time I felt the loneliest… I actually never knew at the moment I was lonely. It actually was a progression of many years. In my younger years I never felt lonely as I was always in a social setting. Dinners, parties, nightclubs and college life seemed to fill the void of companionship. About 5 years ago I stopped drinking and had my first of 3 children. As the bar days were over and I was spending more time at home with my family. Things seemed good and stable.It was around this time that the dynamics in my household started to change. I love my partner to death but as we started to argue more often I realized that she was my only confidant. She was there for when I had work issues, when I was mad at the other drivers on the road or if I just wanted to share a good story about my day. With kids screaming and enough problems of her own, these conversation were becoming further and further apart. I had so much to share, but no one to share with. Scrolling through my phone looking for someone to reach out to, I found no shortage of business associates, old college buddies, some far of relatives but no one that I could share my most inner feelings with. This was when I felt the hurt in my chest knowing that this time I really was alone. I had a bomb of emotions inside me and I needed to diffuse it. I went for a walk, allowed myself to hurt and began to reassure myself that albeit I felt alone in that moment, that out there was another man walking on a path, feeling my same emotions.Loneliness definitely hurts. I have tried to take my experiences and use them to learn about myself and experience how the human soul can persevere. I do long for a meaningful relationship but at the same time I am using this opportunity to develop my own strength and self-awareness so that one day I can be a good friend to the other man walking life’s journey in parallel with me… alone…. for now.""I was, still am I guess, a foster kid. The feeling of abandonment never leaves you, it just continues to grow. My ’family’ was there, but I never belonged. I just drifted in and out of the family experience, feeling like I could disappear any moment and it would be easier for everyone. To this day I still talk to them, and I know they care, but the feeling still follows. I moved and I was even more alone, I would break down every couple of months. Now loneliness is a way of life, and it’s harder than ever to let people in.This may sound like a stand-up routine or a sitcom, but it’s me. Folding sheets. Seriously. When I lived with someone, it was a fun routine, a ritual, a practiced task. Even the cats got involved trying to get into the sheets that were half-way folded, that looked like a hammock to them. Now, living alone, folding sheets is a nightmare. There is no way to be successful. Even if I fold them on the floor, they just get dirty again. And those goddamn fitted sheets! UGH! And then after I’ve stuffed them away in the closet, then pull them out to make my bed with fresh sheets, they resemble used kleenex! So insult to injury, I go to bed at night alone sleeping in these ridiculously creased sheets. Sigh.I’m Indian, so one day at lunch I had my food, this was in 6th grade. Another 6th grader started yelling at me why you eatin’ dat shiiiiit that shiiiiits ugly as an obvious attempt to look cool. If I had a friend with me I could have stood up to him, but I was alone and he was with his friends so I just moved tables.I don’t think there was ever one specific time I felt most lonely. I turned 34 a couple of months ago and it sort of hit me that I am still alone in my mid-thirties. I live in a rural area and there aren’t many prospects so it looks like my being alone isn’t going to change anytime soon. Loneliness is"
