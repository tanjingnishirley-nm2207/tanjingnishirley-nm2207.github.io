"starting to be more apparent to me, and starting to feel more permanent and that really scares me.I have no friends and I’m not close enough with anyone to even message occasionally so when I get bored I go on walks. These walks lead to me thinking about life and then my mood goes down. Once when I was walking I was thinking about being asexual and aromantic and how I’d never get married or move in with someone I love... Then I got thinking about how I’ll have to move in with a friend and rely a lot on friendships. I realized that I’ll never have a boyfriend and I’m honestly terrified of making friends so my future will be filled with being alone in my apartment, not talking to anyone outside of work for months at a time and utter boredom. I wish I had a group of friends, I wish I had a best friend and most of all I wish I wasn’t aromantic/asexual because I hate being alone. I’m going to be alone for the rest of my life...""My wife passed away a little over a year ago. There are many days that I feel this overwhelming sadness but the worst is when I turn to share something with her and I realize that I can’t.I know it will get better but I sure don’t feel like it has. Work helps to fill some of the void but when I am tired or just tired of work, it gets hard to keep going. I am probably depressed but I am still functional, just not happy.It’s been said many times that people just want to be loved and I do believe that is true. I was and now I don’t feel it as much as I used to. My son helps a lot and we connect regularly but he lives pretty far away and it isn’t the same. We have grown closer and we worry about each other.At my age I feel like some sort of dirty old man if I approach a woman and the chance of meeting someone of a similar age is pretty low. I am working on making more of myself and trying to concentrate on things that interest me but there is always that cover of sadness. And then I realize I am whining.""I want to have my own family and should be able to have one but my parents are currently struggling with their jobs and my sister needs help for school so I can’t concentrate on just me. Every Sunday at church when the children are called to the front for the blessing, I want to look away but can’t. I see people my age coming up with their spouse and young children in tow and I think “that could be me” but I’m reminded that I can’t have that. I can’t afford to. I’m needed elsewhere.Christmas. My parents are divorced and when I was 19 I spent Christmas alone. My mom was with her husband and his family. My dad was with his girlfriend and her family. My older siblings were with their significant others and I spent Christmas Eve and Christmas Day alone. I didn’t even get a phone call.It‘s Christmas and we‘re opening gifts. My brother makes a rude comments and my dad gets out of his chair and screeches, why dont you just leave! I hate you!. This ended in a knockdown drag out fight, my mother crying alone in the bathroom and me trying to hold back tears as I open a gift under the now empty tree. Im not sure I like Christmas so much anymore. In practice its wonderful but in reality it feels like acid to my skin.Back home Christmas and New Year were big holidays. In my home country, my city was the country‘s capital so there were always gigantic celebrations with families, relatives, friends, and I was invited to go to a lot of places to celebrate. Here in Canada, one of my parents has to work on either Christmas or New Year. It‘s sad because now, its just my parents, my younger brother and I during the holidays. My youngest brother passed away a few years ago and we already didnt have a lot of people to celebrate it with in this new country... now it hurts even more that my youngest brother passed away. Usually, we just watch TV during the holidays and depending on whether my mom has work or not, she prepares a big feast for like 4 people. If not, we just watch TV and my dad drinks and locks himself in his room until the next day...It was Christmas 1971. My family was downstairs – maybe a dozen people – and I was getting something in my bedroom. I remember looking out the window as the stars came out, listening to the laughter and bubbling conversations drifting up from downstairs, and a feeling went through me that told me I would never ever have this – a happy family of my own. Sadly, it proved to be true.I just had our child after a difficult labor and had my mother come visit us to help out during the first weeks (we lived abroad). Instead my mother was more interested in going out, have coffee with friends than actually be there emotionally for me. When I tried to talk and explain to her that I found the first days of motherhood very difficult and didn’t feel there she was truly being supportive, she told me I needed to stop being emotional and allow her to live her life. The real kicker after this conversation was when she told me that she had put up and was still putting up with dealing with me and my siblings.Having to work in the city when everyone else got to go home for Christmas was always a difficult time but the worst was when I moved to the opposite end of the country to make a fresh start after my relationship ended. I lived with my dad and it brought up so many wounds of the past, I never did make myself at home there and the fresh start never came. I developed a drinking problem, made a lot of stupid mistakes that hurt me, and had a lot of people take advantage of my vulnerability. It has scarred me to this day. Now I have moved again, I have many good friends and a support network close by but I still feel alone much of the time because of having BPD. I am afraid of what loneliness makes me do, the risks I am willing to take to avoid feeling alone. I feel so empty inside. Sometimes I don‘t want to be around people so I avoid them but then I feel isolated and lonely, the longer I spend in my own company the more I hate myself and the less I want to see people, so it becomes an endless toxic cycle.I felt most lonely when I turned 65 and realized that I will be spending the rest of my life with no relatives helping me cross the threshold to death. I’ve read so many obituaries stating that so and so died surrounded by loving family. I will never have that.I felt most lonely when I moved cities for a job and 2 years later realized that I had made no connections deep enough in my new home where I could invite someone or be invited by someone for a Christmas meal. I am Muslim by faith but Christmas had always been a special time for me, so it was a crushing blow to me to realize that I was truly alone in that city.I talk to myself – for other people. I‘m so alone that sometimes I call out to people that aren‘t there for dinner or to come see something on TV. At work, I see people all day, but I go home to an empty house and stay there until I repeat the process. All of my friends have their own partners and/or families and and I am divorced, my kids are grown and being single at my age isolates you so anymore, I feel the most lonely every day. I had a relationship for about 18 months but one day he decided that he didnt want me anymore which intensified the loneliness. Its funny how you can feel something for a long time but then feel it even more after something like that. As if someone peeled back the layer of normal lonely to expose raw lonely. I suppose perhaps Im at my loneliest during the holiday months because while everyone else is celebrating, I am often times by myself or even worse, surrounded by couples and families. One holiday Im fortunate enough to have my children come home, the other Im not. Its tough and I already feel the sting of it and its not even Halloween...Loneliness while in a relationship is the worst – laying next to someone and realizing you are so disconnected, no matter how hard your try, you are better off alone. I endured so much emotional abuse, I felt broken. I know I’m not unique in this, and as a single woman in my 40’s, now I have a fantastic life. At this point, I have been single for a few years, and I am really ready for a solid relationship with a good man. I want the physical and emotional intimacy of having a partner, I want someone with whom I can share my life. It is so frustrating when people who have been married for decades and haven’t ever been alone, say to me “you have to learn how to be happy on your own.” I have more than proven I can thrive as a single and can take care of myself. Holidays are the worst, but at least I still have my parents and siblings. I think I should get a dog, maybe host international students. Create a sense of purpose in having my own, non-biological family, so to speak.""Thought I was in love twice, both guys treated me badly – had to cry for weeks – no-one communicates honestly with a reason why it did not work.Now. My sisters and aunt have alienated my mom and me from their lives over the past couple years. We don’t fit into their perfect, snobby lifestyles and think we’re losers. I’m being judged on behavior from my teens and 20s (along their presumptions of what and who I am), but I have changed so much since then. My mom and I may not be as well off as they are, but we’re not suffering either. My sisters and aunt control all family events and we are no longer invited for birthdays, family dinners or holidays. Even though I think they’re pretty much bitches, it hurts to go from big holidays with 30+ people, to just me and my mom. I feel especially sad and lonely when I think of what my life will be like after my mom is gone. I will have no family left.""My loneliness waxes and wanes. Just recently, I got broken up with in public and was left there, sobbing, by myself. No one stopped to ask if I was okay. I’ve been devastated. I tried to fill my time on the weekend, and I felt like I had no one to spend time with me, so I ended up at a pub by myself and got very intoxicated all alone. I sat on the street for a while, drunk and heartbroken, because I had nowhere to go with my pain.Just like many others, my loneliness is exacerbated by the holidays. I want to spend my holidays with the people I love, and that does not entail my family. I want to spend time with friends, but unfortunately, my family would never allow that. So I’m forced into rooms with extended family members, while I’m incredibly empty and void inside.Sometimes, I feel like I’m destined for loneliness, and maybe I just don’t deserve companionship.""I feel the most lonely when I give in to my expectations of what I imagine life should be like. Example: having my parents still alive and having big holiday gatherings with them or wishing I had grandchildren to love and spoil.""I feel lonely most during holidays and weekends when I don’t have my son. Holidays is a hard time of year overall because I miss family. It’s become harder for me over the last few years.I feel most lonely when I am faced with a household challenge that is typically a blue job. I have no one to help me figure it out (such as electrical work in my oven and leaves that need to be cleaned out of eaves) and no one to call. Well that’s not true, I have plenty of people to call for help but I have a hard time reaching out. I’ve been trying to ask for help, and lately no one is available. I get it, everyone has their own busy lives and can’t be available when I need it. I feel lonely again because it reminds me I’m single and alone, then amplifies the feeling of loneliness.Loneliness sinks in again when I have to schedule my holidays at work. Which is due November 15th. I have no one to plan a vacation with. Yes I can take my son somewhere, but that’s not so simple. I have a medical issue, seizures, and where I had a MVA last year while in vacation with my son. This has been traumatic for him. So it’s not easy for me to go places with him alone, because should something happen to me, I have no one to take care of him. Again, I’m reminded I’m alone and the feeling of loneliness (and then sadness) sets in.I’ve been divorced for 8 years. I was married to a man who is a local in this town. He has a reputation that is not always favourable by some, which leaves the locals avoiding me when it comes to relationships and/or dating. He has been controlling in our marriage, and since I walked out it’s been worse. Since my divorce, I have had experiences where men express their like for me, but because of who my ex can be, they prefer not to have to “deal” with him. I feel that I have been branded in his town, which further makes me feel alone and lonely. I have shared custody and therefore my options of relocating is not great. Most days I’m ok with being single. But it’s because of the examples I listed above, the feeling of being lonely is amplified and acutely at the forefront.Social media is damaging for us all as well. Loneliness has left me feeling depressed and ironically isolating myself. Being around people do not always make me feel less lonely. I’m some situations I felt more alone.I am recently practicing yoga. I am doing my best to be mindful and present. Limiting my time on social media. I am practicing being grateful for the great things in my life and keeping myself busy with friends and family. But even with that, the loneliness haunts me and it’s a fight.""The day my mother died (a long story in and of itself), she had been in the ICU overnight. The doctors came in and told us she had lost all brain activity, and it was just a matter of taking her off the respirator. I was not in the room by myself, but I was the only viable next-of-kin to sign off on removing her life support. One brother was in prison, but the other was only about an hour away. I called him to come and sign with me, and he refused because he “couldn’t do that to Momma.” She had always told us not to let her live comatose – she hated the idea of it. So, I signed my mother’s death warrant by myself, at age 18. I have never felt more loneliness in my life, or more fear, or more sorrow.In seventh grade, there was an eighth grader who constantly harassed me physically and verbally, grabbing my thighs and butt, calling me flat, making unwanted advances, etc, and I finally gathered up the courage to tell a friend. They told me that they just liked me, and I was overreacting and I just wanted attention. Nobody did anything and I can’t open up the same way since.Second year of university, alone in my residence room, having a panic attack as my floor mates had a conversation just outside the door. Having no idea to communicate to them, feeling a mounting wall blocking out those around me. The special, insidious loneliness that comes from the belief that no matter how kind and genuine they seem, the people you know secretly hate you. When trying to explain the worst sides of anxiety and depression, this is often a story I use.I told my sister about our childhood friends having get togethers, and she went out of her way to reconnect with them, after one group get together that I attended, I learned that there had been others that she went to, and even though she knew this was a sorrow in my life, has not made sure that I too was included. I just find myself wondering why am I so forgettable?When I was in elementary school, we moved to yet another state, South Carolina, because my mom was getting back together with someone and I begrudgingly went with her. Not to mention, that guy said that there was a really good job opportunity there so of course we just had to go. I moved there without knowing a single soul and only had my mom to lean on. I was treated quite differently on my first day of school because I was Asian while everyone else just wasn’t. Not the best way to start a new life, especially at my age. My mom was working long hours to support three people and was gone most of the time while the other guy locked himself in his room all day to drink himself out of sobriety, play games, and use up what little hard-earned money she made for gambling purposes. I had never felt so empty and alone; I sunk into depression and didn’t have the will to live anymore.I feel the most lonely when I think about my future. As an unwed, childless woman in her 40’s, I worry about dying alone. Once my parents and older sibling pass away, will I still matter to anyone? Will anyone shed a tear if I get sick or pass away? Does my life matter at that point? I do not regret my decision not to have children. For many reasons, it was the right choice for me. But there is a finality that comes when one is childless, yet no longer able to have children. That finality can be a difficult burden to bear.I was sick a lot during my teenage years because I didn‘t adhere to my medicine as I should have. My illness wasn‘t something we ever discussed, it was taboo, swept under the carpet. I suffered alone and in silence.I was sick a lot during my teenage years because I didn‘t adhere to my medicine as I should have. My illness wasn‘t something we ever discussed, it was taboo, swept under the carpet. I suffered alone and in silence.Believe it or not, when I got engaged. Life was supposed to be fun and exciting and my family was happy and his were happy... only he wouldn‘t plan the wedding, or talk about the future or help me, I felt an overwhelming sense of loneliness not being able to talk to friends or family about how I felt, knowing that this may be the wrong thing to do... but not wanting to ruin their perception. Living a life for someone else and waiting to find out where you are going and what you are supposed to be doing, when that someone else won‘t talk to you... that is lonely and it‘s makes me feel pathetic that I allow it.""As I walked back along the darkening streets tonight, an evening in early May, the birds were still singing and the smell of spring was fresh and floral in the air around me. It reminded me, viscerally, suddenly, of the hill behind my childhood home that Dad and I used to climb after dinner. We’d bring a banana or chocolate mousse and eat them sitting on the bench at the top, looking out at the panoramic views of the city’s old stone and slate roofs.Sometimes, memories like these fill you with warmth, a welcome gift proffered at an unexpected moment. Sometimes, they just serve to remind you of all the things that are different now. In this case, I immediately feel nostalgic for my Dad and my secret language, confined to those pre-adolescent years; for those familiar horizons, the sense of belonging they provoke; for the irrelevance of the future then, a blurry, intangible time in a child’s mind.Since moving here, I’ve been lonely most of the time. Even when I’m with newly-made friends, even when I’m laughing, even when I’m absorbed in a talk or a class or a reading, there are always people and places I miss.I’d already got used to the absence of my city’s old stones, slate roofs, many hills. I’d got used to being an ocean away from my family, my friends, my first boyfriend. But it was different then. Now, I’ve moved away not just from my first home, but also my second, the one I’ve constructed over almost seven years and that I’m still actively shaping every time I return.When I first moved here, I was frustrated by the knowledge that in every coffee shop and lecture hall, there were bound to be like-minded people, potential new friends. This is a university town, after all. There are all sorts of interesting people here and I knew, tantalisingly, that I was probably walking past them in the narrow historic streets every single day.It was different in the place that has become my second home. There, the loneliness of the first six months were combatted by making friends and basking in the knowledge that we’d have another four years together in the same place, embarking upon and later completing our first university degrees. Here, there’s barely enough time to finish the reading lists, let alone spend hours over a beer getting to know someone. Given the nature of academic rigour in this place, the former activity often takes precedence.Now that I’m almost done, the course finishing in a flash of visiting scholar talks, library fines and wine receptions, I am telling myself that those potential friends don’t matter anymore. I am telling myself that I will walk over the cobbles and down the lanes content with my own company, happy in the knowledge that my community is elsewhere and it’s not going anywhere: it’s me that left, it’s me that will return. I am telling myself, as my partner so often tells me from across the ocean (in the other direction, this time), to be happy with what I am doing rather than what I could be doing. Some days it works, and I feel strength in solitude, rather than weakness in isolation.But some days, when the smell of spring is especially strong, or the sound of silence becomes too loud, it makes me wish for another time, another place. And on those days, I ride it out, I try to write a little, I (often unsuccessfully) avoid reaching for my phone to replicate absent people’s presences with messages (because it’s never the same), and I remind myself that I chose this. I chose to move away and move away and move away again. And equally, I will choose to move back.In this way, loneliness is a temporary state, and, ultimately, a necessary one. For without loneliness, how could we ever truly appreciate company? Without loneliness, would those memories return to us so visceral, full-bodied, nostalgia-inducing? I don’t think so. It is loneliness, then, that allows us, that gives us the time and space and necessary aloneness, to reflect on all that was and all that is still to come.""""August 2017, it was a sunny summer day. I was sitting in my back yard with my 3 rescue Chihuahuas snuggled at my feet. I was talking to my pups and saying how much I love them. I was all alone, except for my pups and the nature of birds chirping in the cedar trees next to me. I was on social media on my phone, and reading all the posts of others (friends/family/others). They all seemed socially successful in life that day, I observed. My friends/family and strangers‘ posts were those of them going to work, going to school, going to the mall, going out for coffee with friends, etc. I was overwhelmed by the thought, I had no one to call up or text and say Lets get together. I wasnt able to drive (that day due to fatigue) from my Synthroid Im on after my Thyroid Cancer. I was feeling very low self esteem and I wanted a visitor to chat with and cheer me up, but everyone was busy, except for myself. I gave my pups some huge hugs, and that made me feel happier! Some days are still quite lonely, thats okay. I have learned to accept it as rest time, thinking time, and peaceful quiet time. I make sure to make these lonely days, great days! I start the day by writing, playing with my pups, exercising, listening to music, baking, going to the beach, dancing around the house, watching funny movies, and sipping some good coffee! Everyday, Im thankful to be here to share my story.""When I try to make a friend and their interests are alcohol and mine are adventures and swords and history, and not only are they they not asking me anything back and nodding off the things I share voluntarily, I have to really work at asking questions to keep them talking about themselves.Later in life I wound up in a leadership role with more than forty employees and several direct reports at the company where I worked. It was a high profile position that involved public speaking, television appearances, attending galas, and meeting upon meeting. I was inundated with people coming and going from my office. I had a narcissistic boss who was emotionally abusive. I realized that I was the buffer for all these wonderfully talented people but I couldn‘t really talk about how difficult the experience was for me with anyone at the office. When things became really challenging, I would take long walks, stay in the washroom for longer periods of time, or I would get sick and stay home from work. Even though I had this highly public job, I was utterly lonely.Not too long ago I fell into a deep depression where I developed severe anxiety and gender dysphoria. Nothing could fill the void in my heart; my job, cars, friends or even substance abuse. Growing up I was always more inclined to be feminine and couldn’t understand why it was so shameful to be gay or transgender. With constant pressure from my family to not come out I tended to shut down or close myself off from everyone around me. Until I finally burst letting all my feelings out all at once and to such a relief my mom wasn’t angry. Although she still isn’t very comfortable with me being transgender I’m sure one day she will when she sees me happy to be myself. For now I’m still finding my way in this world, often alone and against the beliefs of everyone around me. Shout out to all the renegades out there, just know that there are others even if they aren’t near.I was a new mum and had recently lost both my parents. These were profound experiences that affected me deeply, in good and bad ways. None of my close friends had experienced any of this which made it difficult to share what I was feeling. Ultimately I feel I‘m more human because of what I learned from this time.I think I‘ve felt lonely throughout my life and I am truly alone except for my dog. Christmas guts me every year. I already accept there will be not even a phone call for me. I have bought a pre-cooked meal and a slice of pie. My evening walk with the dog takes my soul every year for curtains are open into living rooms full of families and friends, I can hear them, sometimes smell their turkey dinners, but most of all I feel all their happiness knowing I will never have it. I get home and get into bed and cry and will the day away with sleep.There is no one time I felt the most lonely, I think. For me, lonely has been an ever growing sensation. It multiplies with every realization I have that my old friends don‘t care about me anymore, with every excited thought that quickly dies because I have no one who will want to hear it, and with each event I consider going to then don‘t because I know I‘ll never have as much fun alone as I would with other people. Loneliness lives in my stomach constantly, and I can feel it eating all my organs with each week that passes. It‘s like a parasite. But then again, Im only 18, what do I fucking know.""I was working on a cruise ship and was emergency disembarked in Barbados for a suspected appendicitis. It turned out to be a ruptured ovarian cyst. The doctor told me I wouldn‘t be able to have kids. I spent 2 days in the hospital and 2 days in a hotel before being flown back to meet the ship. Those days in Barbados were the loneliest I‘ve ever been. I was in pain, I was scared, Id been told something I always wanted wouldnt happen and I had nothing to distract myself (no television or books). I couldnt call my family or friends. Besides the medical staff checking on me, I only had the ships port agent stop by with my passport. It was awful.3 years later, on my last cruise contract, I was trained for a care program where crew will stay in port with passengers or crew members who are dealing with a crisis. The new program was designed to avoid what happened to me. I cried during the training and told the trainer how important this new program was. It would have made all the difference for me.""My partner of nearly five years and I broke up. It was not a healthy relationship. My partner was abusive towards me and people knew she could be difficult to deal with. When we broke up, I was the one who had to leave and the queer community that we shared abandoned me and isolated me because my ex wouldn‘t acknowledge the break up and continued to party and go out. I‘ve never felt more lonely in my life. All these relationships I had spent nearly five years putting effort into completely disappeared. People who are supposed to have good politics, and work in social work, or are doulas, took the easy route, fully knowing my ex‘s behaviour towards me was unacceptable. She offered them more social capital than I did and I lost my entire life.""When I sat in a coffee shop and realized everyone around me was locked into their electronic device. Earbuds in place, there was not an inch of space into which I could start a conversation.As a society, I believe we are the architects of our isolation. But I‘m hopeful that one day the need for real interaction in a meaningful way will get people to put down their devices and casually strike up a conversation with other people nearby.""I spent two hours alone wandering around an IKEA because I was too nervous to ask people to come with me. I ate two hotdogs and bought nothing.I was attending a large church that I had donated my design services to -- I had done the interior design for an entire campus of buildings for them. Both of my children were baptized there and I tried to attend every Sunday I was able. I was in the midst of struggling to understand the burgeoning special needs of my now 3 year old daughter, feeling so daunted, frustrated, scared and alone. I got a text from the nursery, telling me my daughter was throwing a tantrum and asking if I could come back. I ducked out of the Sunday morning service and was walking across the campus to the children‘s building. One of the mothers I knew was out there walking as well. She asked how I was and I admitted to my bewilderment with the health and behavioral problems with my little girl. She looked at me smugly, knowingly, and suggested that if I would stay at home and give my daughter the time and attention she clearly needed, perhaps this wouldnt be a problem for me any longer. I was stunned, shocked, horrified. Every possible molecule of mother-guilt surged up inside me and I realized that she didnt understand. And I wondered if I would ever find a like-minded soul who had walked the path I was on. I felt impossibly alone right then. And I have tried really, really hard to never judge another mothers path. It can be incredibly lonely at times.The time I felt the most lonely was at the 17km mark of my first half marathon. I trained for weeks and begged everyone I knew to please come support me at the finish line. Not one person came. I knew for sure at km 17 that no one was there for me because you had to run near where the finish line was. I spent the next 4 kilometres feeling sorry for myself.To me, one of the worst things about being lonely is that it can often seem like something desirable. Theres something sexy about being sad, alone, tormented by deep thoughts. Drinking in the rain at 4:00 AM listening to post-rock. It feels like youre in a movie (think Ryan Gosling in Drive), and as long as you can keep dissociating from reality, it actually feels good. But that feeling doesnt last long, because its predicated on the idea that if only people could see me now, theyd know how tortured and lonely and sexy I am -- and no one is watching. So when you reluctantly come back to reality, youre tipsy and soaking wet in the middle of the night wondering why you ever wanted to be alone in the first place. And thats when the real loneliness hits you.""It was my first day on kindergarten, the first time I had ever really been around other kids my age. I was so excited, but of course nervous to meet all my new peers. I remember getting there and my mom had to leave for work, so I waited patiently by myself for the class door to open. I watched as other kids began to arrive with their parents. There I was standing all alone, in the cold fall breeze, watching all my soon to be classmates latching onto their parents and smiling. I stood there for another ten minutes observing all of them. Eventually the door opened and the teacher started to welcome everyone. I looked around as all the kids hugged their parents and said goodbye to them, their parents hugging and kissing them back. I was the only kid there that had no parent to kiss or hug them goodbye, because my mom was a single parent and couldn‘t afford to be late for work. Throughout the day I was laughing and smiling and completely ignoring what had happened earlier. The memory had completely swept out of my mind, I was too focused playing with all my new friends.After the day had ended, i soon realized it was time to leave class and go home. Our teacher announced she would dismiss us from the class once she met our parents. All the kids started walking out of the door, practically leaping into their parents arms, blabbering on about how amazing their day was. Their parents all smiled while they rambled on "
