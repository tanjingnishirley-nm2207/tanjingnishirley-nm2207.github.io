"aimlessly.Me on the other hand......I had to wait 45 minutes after class had ended for my mom to come pick me up. I sat there, while my teacher just typed away at her computer. The class was silent and made me feel stuck. I just wanted to be like all the other kids in my class. I wanted to be able to hug my mom goodbye, I wanted to be able to leave class on time and tell her about my day. I wanted to be normal, or what I, being five, thought was supposed to be normal. I felt all alone.""Again my husband has deployed after we moved to a new town. I don‘t know a soul here. I feel soo alone. The kids dont have friends and families are provinces away. People are so unfriendly here i just want to go home. This is the most lonely i have ever felt.there’s no one time, but i was completely alone and almost fully nocturnal for about 6 months. i’d maybe see family members for about 10 minutes a day, if i was lucky. this was in the pre-ubiquitous internet era, and before i had a cell phone, so i was completely alone. i was dealing with some health issues, so i couldn’t read books. all i had was tv and my dog (when she wasn’t sleeping/hanging out upstairs with my sleeping family members). you start talking to things -- yourself, out loud, your food, the tv, the walls. you develop an even richer inner life, filled with more characters and more fantasy, because it’s all you have. you try to squeeze every second out of possible interactions, because they’re so special and small and fleeting. i’m sort of amazed i survived it.I went into the car to go to daycare. It took a long time waiting for mama and Thomas. After my mum died and there was nobody left who knew all the same people and to whom I could tell news. As a child, realising that almost everyone else had siblings - I had none.I was raised as a Jehovah‘s Witness. I struggled to leave the faith for years, living a secret life where I hid many things about myself. I used coping mechanisms of drugs and alcohol because I felt trapped and was severely depressed and suicidal. When you leave that faith you get cut off from everyone in it. I knew what would come and I couldn‘t bare to say goodbye. These were people who I had known and loved for years, some my entire life. People who had told me they would be in my life forever. It was almost five years ago when my mother left my house for the last time, when she realized I had finally really left the faith, I wept but she didn‘t. She just said goodbye. I had no one to turn to because consolation was not possible at that time. It was the loneliest I‘ve ever felt."
