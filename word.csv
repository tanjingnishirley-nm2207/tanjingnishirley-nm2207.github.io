At a party. It wasn’t my scene. The conversation was mind-numbing. Would have preferred to be at home with a good book.
"Later in life I wound up in a leadership role with more than forty employees and several direct reports at the company where I worked. It was a high profile position that involved public speaking, television appearances, attending galas, and meeting upon meeting. I was inundated with people coming and going from my office. I had a narcissistic boss who was emotionally abusive. I realized that I was the buffer for all these wonderfully talented people but I couldn’t really talk about how difficult the experience was for me with anyone at the office. When things became really challenging, I would take long walks, stay in the washroom for longer periods of time, or I would get sick and stay home from work. Even though I had this highly public job, I was utterly lonely."
"My loneliness comes in waves. I feel very lonely when I think about my niece back home, and how I’ve only met her once, and haven’t seen her in person in two years. I feel lonely that she gets to hang up on me whenever she likes on FaceTime because I’m not truly physically a person to her. And that can also be a little bit funny. My loneliness comes in waves. I feel very lonely when I think about my niece back home, and how I’ve only met her once, and haven’t seen her in person in two years. I feel lonely that she gets to hang up on me whenever she likes on FaceTime because I’m not truly physically a person to her. And that can also be a little bit funny. I feel lonely when I hear people talking about immigrants in a particular way, because I am an immigrant, even though I don’t look like what people perceive an immigrant to be. I feel lonely that my partner doesn’t like my country’s cuisine. I feel lonely when I want to greet people with a warm hug and kisses on their cheeks, but Canadians don’t really like being touched. I feel lonely when nobody asks me about Brazil, or asks how my family is doing."
"I’m not sure if there was one specific time, but to me the feeling of loneliness has encompassed my 20s. It’s the feeling that everyone else around me knows exactly what they want out of their lives - the type of partner they want, the career they’re pursuing. I’ve never felt clear about who I am and as a result it has been difficult to define what I want out of my time on this planet. It can be very isolating and, well, lonely to feel that everyone around you is moving forward while you remain cemented to where you are. Loneliness to me is not knowing which direction to step, and watching those around me walk miles ahead without looking back. While I’m happy for them, I just wish I could keep up."
"Some nights when my depression gets bad, I badly need someone to talk to, and the first time I had a full on wave of depression was the first time I realized I had no one to talk to about it. No one I knew was I comfortable to share it with, and my parents were definitely out of the picture. I was forced to internalize it, and the next day when I went to school I expected people to notice that I was not alright, and that I needed someone to talk to and didn’t know who to reach out to. No one noticed. I realized then that it didn’t matter how I felt on the inside and how well I knew myself if everyone I know sees me as a bright and happy girl. If I’m the only person that actually knows who I am, how does anyone really know me at all? Are we really the people we know ourselves to be if everyone else has a different image of us? Do I exist outside of their main image of me?"
"Whenever I am tired after work, or sick, and want nothing more than to get into pajamas and be comfortable - but then I realize that there is no food in the house or no cold medicine, and there is no one there I can ask hey, can you do me a favor and go get Sudafed, and I have to get back out of my pajamas and trudge out to the market to get it myself. Whenever that happens, I always feel that there is no one who has my back at the little moments when I need it; I do have friends I know would help when I have a genuine crisis, but it‘s someone having your back in the mundane moments that REALLY matters."
"Last summer was kind of hard. Both my kids are now married and their military lives have taken them far away. My husband was in and out of town all spring / summer doing military training. My best friend got a new boyfriend and stopped doing our usual routines (going to our favorite sandwich shop, doing carpentry projects, hiking, and just getting into mischief). My husband and I found land closer to his work that is actually within a series of small neighborhoods, with people who have similar interests/hobbies. We‘re in the process of buying it and starting a new chapter where we can actually KNOW people we live around. Everyone there seems very nice and relatable. But it‘s also been hard to think about moving from the home I raised my children, and moving away from my best friend. I‘ve been having a really hard time with nostalgia. Music from my youth, thinking about being a child again... and wondering if there will be fun times to be had and memories to be made when I look back on this time in 20 years from now."
"I was in Boston for a summer internship. I knew two people there from back home who were going to school. One of them was one of my best friends. We had known each other since Kindergarten. I was so depressed and lonely being in a new city by myself with my boyfriend back in California and my family in Colorado. I would go to work and basically come right back home to an empty house. I explored the city a lot on my own but it only did so much. I wanted to see my friend so badly, but she didn‘t have time for me. She had school and her own life there, and I felt like she didn‘t even care that I was in the same city as her, even though we hadn‘t seen each other in a year. One day she finally told me she didn‘t want to see me. She said she couldn‘t be friends with someone who made her feel guilty for not spending time with them. That was not my intention at all, I just really needed a friend at that time. I suffer from depression normally and being isolated in a new city was making it worse. I havent seen or really talked to her since. To make matters worse, right before the holidays another one of my best friends from elementary school back home told me she couldnt be friends with someone who didnt support our president (Trump!) and blocked my phone number and me on all outlets of social media. She was one of the only friends I had left that still lived in my hometown. Now being home for the holidays is just a lonely reminder that I will never have those friendships that I cherished so much again."
"As I sit alone, in the upstairs spare room of my parents house, I come to terms of just how lost I feel. It has been two years since my family and I have moved almost 3,000 miles away from my old home, and even though moving is second nature to me, tonight, the feelings I have encountered are nothing short than devastating. Mixed with seasonal depression, homesickness, and the stress a future I have yet to figure out and stabilize – I attempt to complete the endless amounts of worksheets and forms to pass my high school classes, as well as college classes I dual enrolled in. I am already behind. Tonight is also Halloween. The fact alone, that I have done nothing at all to celebrate my favorite holiday, nor acknowledge its existence this year, due to my work load and unrelenting stress leaves me upset. In such a state that it‘s painful to continue on working. I can barely recall any months past August of this year; it ends up in becoming a blur of me counting down hours until the next deadline, and consuming unhealthy amounts of caffeine and sugar to keep my body awake.  Maybe the worst part about it is my entire family is out celebrating with their friends. They are out trick or treating, partying, and conversing with people they know and love while I‘m left crying all over the couch because I don‘t have a single friend in the entire state. But maybe that‘s just selfish. My best friends, who live now very far away from me, are partying too. They have a group chat open and keep sending me photos of how much fun they are having, making me sick to my stomach. Eventually it got so painful I had to silence the messages and put my phone on the other side of the room. Deep somewhere, I wonder if they even care about me anymore, or if they keep up appearances because I try to remain friends with them."
"Ever since I got married and came to live in another country. It has not been easy. I feel really alone. The people in this country are very friendly but they are not looking for friends. It’s very hard to find a group of friends here. That, and the language barrier. I haven’t felt this lonely in my life. I often think it was not worth to get married, he’s a good person and tries his best but it’s not enough."
"After college, I moved to a different state for work, where I had literally no family or friends prior to moving. I had such high hopes of making a fresh start for myself and finally meeting my squad, that Friends-esque type family that you build for yourself and aren‘t born into. Well, finding that is easier said than done, but I felt that I had found that with my coworkers. We‘re all around the same age and enjoy spending time with one another. However, as time goes on, I‘ve found that we‘re drifting apart and don‘t really connect the same way we used to. We used to all go to lunch together, and would round everyone up so we could all eat together in the break room. Recently though, I looked up from my computer and realized that I was all alone in the office. It was 11:30, and everyone had gone to lunch without me, and never told me that they were leaving. I felt so abandoned and isolated, that it triggered my loneliness again and I‘ve been struggling to cope since. Ive found that being left out of group conversations, jokes, etc. is a big trigger for me, and so even though this incident was small, it felt so deliberate, that Ive been wondering why my squad has decided that Im not important enough to them to include on a regular basis anymore. What did I do wrong? Why dont I warrant their interaction, companionship and camaraderie? Thankfully, I have a wonderful best friend that lives in the same city as I do now, and my family (my parents in particular) are the people Im closest to in the world, so I know that I can pick up the phone, day or night, and talk to the people who love me more than anything else in the world. Im so incredibly grateful for this, but I long to have the squad goals that everyone else my age seems to have. Then that leads to feeling guilty for not being appreciative enough of the people that I do have in my life, causing a vicious cycle of loneliness, guilt and despair."
"I went to a party that my two friends were hosting. I got a haircut the day before, and even though my hair was short, I really liked it. I walked in the door, and everyone went, Your hair! Some people said nice things, but most people just commented on how short it was. I went to go surprise my best friend, and she turned around and couldn’t stop laughing. She told me it was the worst haircut I’ve EVER had, and that I looked like a guy. I felt my gut shrivel up a bit, but I brushed it off, pretending not to care.

Later on at the party, there was music playing. Half the people were dancing, and the other half were sitting on the side and judging (including my best friend). I got sick sitting on the side, so I got up to dance. A couple of my new friends dancing hyped me up, and then I saw my best friend laughing at me.
I was actually making an attempt to dance, so I kept doing it, but no one was paying attention to me, and I felt just really alone. I called my parents to pick me up.

I’m still friends with my best friend, but I don’t know what to do. She’s nice to me most of the time, but she just has these mean things she does. I can’t ditch her because she’s one of my only friends, and the oldest, and my parents love her.

I wish I could just be me."
"I created a network on the sunshine coast for women who felt lonely. As a result of that I was at a 60th Birthday Party and everyone who was at that party the host had met through the group. It was a great night, lots of laughing and dancing. I was the only one who‘s partner didn‘t come along, and I sat at the back of the room watching, feeling very proud but also so lonely."
"My best friend who was practically my sister started ignoring me. I still don’t know why. I’ve tried reaching out and letting her know how hurt I am and how much she means to me. She hasn’t acknowledged how I feel or explained herself. I know she might be going through her own stuff, but the lack of the most basic acknowledgment still has me feeling anxious, angry, helpless, taken advantage of, and worthless. She was the closest friend I had. If she could do this to me, my other friends could too. This made me feel so alone and paranoid."
"I‘ve never been in a relationship with anyone. Hell, I‘ve never even kissed anyone. There have been a couple of girls who I‘ve liked, but none of them were ever interested in me. Whenever I hear other guys my age talk about girls, they‘re always talking about sex. How they would like to try a threesome, or anal or god-knows-what. I would just want to have somebody to hug me. Someone to hold hands with when we walk, someone to talk to endlessly, someone to go to concerts and festivals with me. I want someone to sleep with, literally. Stare at the stars and falling asleep in each others arms. It all seemed so hopeful 2 weeks ago. I matched with this girl via Tinder. She was everything I ever hoped for. Kind, super pretty, lived relatively nearby and (at least via text) super nice to talk to. We chatted for about 2 months before she finally agreed to go on a date with me. Everything was set, location, date, time, you name it. I had made countless preparations, bought her flowers, practiced how to fold crane birds in case she went to the bathroom during our date, thought about jokes to tell her, printed out a staple of funny question cards we could ask each other in case there would fall an awkward silence. I had even washed my shoes, or at least made an effort to. But the day that it all would happen she texted me. She wanted to cancel the date since she felt like she wasnt ready yet to start a (new) relationship. I felt so sad, broken and alone. I had been looking forward to this for god-knows-how-long. I replied as kind and understanding as I could, which she really appreciated, but she had already made up her mind. We have kept contact since then, and Ive tried to arrange a second date. This time just as friends though. It might happen sometime next week. I remain hopeful, I cant wait to see her and talk to her in real life sometime. Even if we would become only friends Id still be super happy."
"I’m in a city which allows for so much adventure and experience. So many people to meet and things to do. I’m surrounded by opportunities. And yet I’m lonely. I feel so alone. I‘m young and I know I have a future ahead of me but right now I‘m living in hell. I‘m being told that I‘m living the best years of my life but if this is what Ill feel for the next 70 years, then I dont want to experience the rest. It’s scary to feel this isolated, so removed from your own life. I cant name when I felt the most lonely because its not predictable or constant. I never know when my mind is going to sabotage me and am never prepared so the feeling is always the same; miserable and agonising. I think I’m only starting to starting to realise it’s not solely a feeling, it’s a living. It’s a part of my life and myself and its a part of human nature. I know Im not alone in my feelings but still, I feel lonely. P.S. Im only sad so when I say I dont want to experience the rest of my life I dont meant that in a literal sense. I am in fact looking forward to growing up and hopefully growing away from this loneliness."
My wife and I used to watch a lot of TV and movies together. It‘s been a struggle to get her to watch anything anymore with me. Finally I did get her to sit down and watch something we had been wanting to watch for a long time. A cringe worthy moment came that made me laugh and I turned to my wife and said Can you believe they did that? She‘s on her phone and after a long pause she just says Uh huh. She doesn‘t stop or even look up. At that moment I wished I had someone to share that moment with. I realized I had no one else and the thought of finding someone terrified me.
"For me loneliness isn’t an emotion that fluctuates so much as something that feels like a permanent part of my being. I learned at a young age that I could only count on myself for emotional support and that reaching out for help or appearing vulnerable is a bad thing (rationally I know this isn’t true and I’m in the process of unlearning some very bad habits and coping mechanisms but it’s not easy). I spent most of my life framing my loneliness as something empowering - I was completely self sufficient and didn’t need anyone’s help for anything, desperate to ignore the innate yearning for intimate human connection. I’m quite social and I have good friends but I’ve never been in a truly intimate relationship. The loneliness has become so much a part of me that, even though I recognize it’s sad and harmful, the idea of not being lonely is scary and confounding."
"I was in the hospital for a surgery. My boyfriend at the time didn’t visit because he couldn’t be bothered, and my friends all said they were too busy to show up. That night, I saw them on someone’s Snapchat story at a party. What stung the most however, was me knowing that had they been in my position, I would’ve crossed mountains to come running with get well cards, flowers and whatever else they would’ve wanted. I’ve done such things countless times before after all. Yet, I couldn’t even get so much as a visit. The only person who showed up was my mother, who raised me on her own. It made me want to never do a kind thing for anyone ever again."
"I felt most lonely the night the man I loved got married to someone else. He was my best friend for four years and the only man I ever really connected with. When we broke up, it was due to mounting pressure from third parties, not because either of us wanted out. I was young and stupid, and realized too late that I could have fought harder for our relationship. 2.5 years later and I still miss him every damn day. The worst part is, he started dating someone else within a few months and never looked back. My best friend went to his wedding."
"I had a serious bout of anxiety come over me after I found out that my cancer came back. I remember sitting on my futon in my dorm room, alone, just crying for hours, just telling myself that I was going to be okay. No friends were there, and my family was on the other side of the state. All I needed was a very long hug from someone, literally anyone, but I didn’t want to seem weak. I eventually reached out to a therapist. It was the best decision I had ever made. I’m a lot better now."
"I feel the most lonely when I‘m writing JavaScript. It feels like my soul is in an infinite loop, spiralling into the void with no help in sight."
"I was recently diagnosed with a mood disorder that has made my emotions unrecognizable to myself. I‘m angry or sad or anxious without cause. My partner is afraid of me because I can‘t check my reactions. I‘m in treatment, but I don‘t think its working, and I cant return to intense psychiatric care until the end of the year or Ill lose my job. I feel like Im going crazy and everyone in my life is just watching it happen."
"I think everyone thinks they can save someone. That is the trap I fell into. My wife came from an abusive family and she wanted nothing more than to escape and I became her knight in shining armour who would whisk her away. Even during the early years of our marriage her libido was low, at least that is what I thought. I have come to realize that the truth is she despises being touched and avoids any physical contact when possible. I think the true depth of my loneliness became obvious after our son was born 15 years ago. A few months after he was born I was trying to get romantic with my wife who had been totally unresponsive since the pregnancy and I remember clearly what she said now that I have my son, I never have to have sex with you. I grew up in a cold German family and all I ever wanted was someone who would touch me and hold me, and now 27 years after saying I do, I am even lonelier than I was growing up."
"Today I sorted through yet another box of my husband Roy’s life. The cardboard box contained an assortment of documents, a few photographs, the receipt of the purchase of his first new car, a collection of cards from birthdays past, university and high school diplomas, expired drivers licenses, receipts of car insurance payments, and a few other markers of his life before me. I had always believed I knew everything about Roy’s life while growing up. Now I find empty spaces and surprises to fill them. Roy had once taken me to his University campus in Alberta, Canada, I had attended several of his High school reunions, listened to many stories from his adolescent years, met old friends and buddies from his Military years and yet here are new facts and new faces to complete the picture. I found two High school diplomas: one issued in Roy’s hometown, from Fergus County High School in the year 1954 and another one dated in1955 from Canada. Perhaps the diploma issued in Canada was a requirement for admission to the University of Alberta? I also learned that Roy served in the National Guard in Montana and yet he was drafted into the Army. I find it interesting that the VW beetle he purchased from the factory in Germany cost him 5,500 DM, which at that time was equal to 1,375 U$...and while I turn these documentations around in my hands, I felt a growing need to share my emotions with Roy. I wanted to dive into memories with him and also relive the ones we did share, sit in that seafoam green Volkswagen and explore Europe and the US together one more time, the beginning of our relationship becoming fresh and new again. As many memories flooded my mind and the realization that we never again would share these memories became reality, I was surprised that my sadness focused on him, on Roy. In those early years, it was him who created them. While I rejoice with happy memories he no longer can. It is up to me to nurture and keep them alive. There he is, sitting across the table from me. The expression on his face tells me that he has noticed the tears rolling across my cheeks. He looks puzzled and uncomfortable. In these long years of the advancement of dementia, his life disappeared with the slow loss of memory – he lost his wife, his children, and finally himself. How can anyone cope with such tragedy? The process of experiencing fear, denial, anger and shame must finally give in to total darkness. He and I shared these stages differently, but together. In the end I am the keeper of these memories."
"A few years ago, I got laid off and my car was totaled in the same weekend. I couldn‘t find work anywhere and I had no savings, so I started walking and taking the bus anywhere I needed to go. As money got tighter I started selling my clothes, books, and furniture...but it wasn‘t enough. I lost 30 pounds because I couldn‘t afford groceries. I got fired from a contract job after two weeks when my boss saw me walking to work. Finally, I started missing rent payments. I had to do the thing I dreaded: Get the courage to ask my mom if I could borrow money. She blew up at me. She wrote me an email telling me that the only thing I cared about was money, I was always an ungrateful brat, and I didn‘t deserve anything from her. No one has ever understood what it was like to grow up with a mother like that, and I still feel incredibly lonely that I can‘t talk to anyone about it."
"Here. Now. As I write this, and the day before. The day after I submit this. I’ve lost my way in the forest and if I could do it by myself, I’d be out by now. There is no significant story attached. I stayed inside and kept myself away from everybody out of a shame that was self-given but never deserved. There is so much in my life to be picked up and put back together. There is so much I’ve given up under the false pretense that I deserved nothing. I am slowly working my way into allowing myself the sweetness of vulnerability, but until I reach that... I’ll always be a strange alien girl whose only company is a fluffy little cat (and even he prefers to hide under the bed alone)."
"This is kind of recent. My grandma passed away in January of this year and she used to be one of the closest people to me, so, ever since she died I just can‘t shake off this feeling of being alone. She used to be my neighbour so we saw each other almost everyday because she needed help with a lot of things in her house and at night we even watched soap operas together, so we always kept each other company. I‘m not saying I loved every single minute I‘ve spent there, because sometimes she was very easily annoyed and I am a crazy mess, but it was nice and now it just seems like a part of me was ripped and I‘m all alone again."
"I feel lonely every time a go to work. I have been in this position for five years and have a large amount of knowledge in this area of medicine. There is a clique within the group that for lack of better terms are the “mean girls” - they do whatever possible to damage the person that is a “threat”. I am a threat because I am well liked by other staff and the management - because I do my job well, and I do extra where and when it is needed. This makes the clique look bad, because they do the bare minimum. Being the target of the “mean girls” means you are left out of dinners, parties, breakfast plans, lunch, camping trips, etc. I get to hear them talk all about if after the fact (telling me “you were working”) or hear them try to quietly make plans. I have been left to complete a large wound dressing change in the operating room, only to be asked the next day “Where did you go? We assumed you left early” (knowing full well I had the late case). While this shouldn’t bother me, it does horribly. It has made me realize how alone I am and how I have focused on medicine and being good at what I do – which should be a good thing, but they have made sure to let me know it isn’t in their eyes and that I am not wanted. This feeds the anxiety and fear that since I don’t belong with professional peers, that maybe I am truly not good enough outside of work for anyone else. It is crippling to be worn down to this – and to realize I am truly alone."
"After 32 years my husband left our marriage. We were living out of state and I decided to move back to the area where I grew up and raised our two children. I was looking forward to reconnecting with old friends and family but I had been away for awhile. I realized you really can‘t go home. No one seems to have the time or desire to reconnect with me even though friends and family all say the love me and are so happy to have me back in the area. My children live out of state and both have very successful careers and significant others. In the past two weeks I haven‘t had any contact with anyone except for my daughter texting me here and there. I mean I go shopping, to the gym and run errands but that‘s about it. I am having trouble finding a job. I was a stay at home mom devoting all my time and energy in making a good home for my family. I never thought that this would be my life at 60. "
"Moving out on my own in my first apartment a couple of months ago. Drinking and smoking are the only things that make me feel better about myself. Nobody will ever know how lonely I am. Being a young professional, with a degree and a career, a new fancy car, a closet full of fancy clothes, knowing full well that I am good-looking and smart, yet all these outwards signs of success don‘t mean a thing when you have no one to share them with. Feeling that emptiness inside on a daily basis and knowing full well that we are at an age when people have their circle already and wondering if I will ever feel the opposite of loneliness."
"I feel so silly even writing these words out. One of the times I felt the most lonely was last year, one of my best friends had just been broken up with, and I was writing positive things about her in a list to make her feel better. I wanted her to read it so she‘d know how amazing she is. She was hanging out with another one of her friends, so I was tagging along, a foot or two behind them. They were talking and laughing and I felt like my list was so unnecessary and I felt dumb. She finally read the list and she hugged me and told me how much she appreciated me and how good of a friend I was before going back to her conversation. That night I texted her and told her how I felt left out and how sometimes I felt like I was a liability without directly telling mentioning it was because of her other friends. After sending it, I immediately started regretting it because I sounded so clingy, like I was saying that my best friend wasn‘t allowed to have other friends. I realized that I always end up clinging when I find someone that even remotely likes me and I end up driving them away. It‘s a defense mechanism for me growing up, no one gave me the validation I crave now."
"As a caregiver for many years to my ageing mother, who has multiple mental and physical health problems, I am confronted with both her loneliness and my own. Her inability to function on her own and her loss of her essence and personality have resulted in her not having any friends who truly know her and appreciate her for the fun-loving and sweet person she is. Everyone just perceives her as crazy or needy. As for me, I miss my mom and get angry at her for her helplessness. I have no siblings or partner to share the work and emotional strain with. Friends are casually supportive, but mostly I am isolated and exhausted by the effort of just keeping her afloat. Institutional care and social programs are sorely lacking, especially if you are not wealthy. I am now losing touch with joy and my personality too."
"So many examples, yet one that stands out is wanting a divorce from my marriage. I had only been married for a few years and my family and friends turned away from me. I felt defeated and I had nobody close in my life to talk to about my feelings and what I was going through; I felt so lonely. Luckily, I learned that by trusting my instincts it helped me discover more about my needs and wants in my life. Regardless, loneliness is something that doesn‘t seem to go away."
"My junior year of high school. I was going through an eating disorder and an abusive relationship, but I couldn’t tell anyone close to me for fear of getting in trouble. I remember sitting in my Algebra 2/Trigonometry class (I was failing), right after my teacher looked me in the eyes and asked me if I needed help, if I was okay. I sat in my seat and felt the world come crashing down. I didn’t think there was another human being on the planet who would be able to help me or understand. I felt like I was going to feel like that forever. I remember feeling like everyone around me knew exactly what they were doing. No one else had a hard time understanding the lessons or falling asleep at night. I couldn’t even cry I just felt so empty and alone."
"Hands down Pride weekend. Pride is billed as the time when you can get together with your chosen family and celebrate however you identify as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. However, from my first Pride as a recently out-to-myself-and-close family 22-year-old, I‘ve just felt very isolated. Everyone seemed to be in a group of friends, or holding hands with their special someone. I felt invisible and unwanted. Since then, I‘ve become more involved with some parts of the gay community, so at least I have things to do and people to talk to during the celebrations. However, it still feels like I‘m totally alone as I walk through the streets of the festival."
"I was sitting with my friends and looked around. All of them paired up in couples, with pets at their feet, children...I never felt quite so alone, so othered, so different and isolated, as I did in that moment while surrounded by loved ones."
"When I was 36, I was singing in front of a crowd of about 100 people. I suffered a stroke. Cue the laughter and the jokes! When my wife got me to the hospital, the doctors thought I had a mental breakdown. Several months later, I was given the news: A rare progressive neurological condition that would shorten my life considerably. To make matters worse, the same condition that my abusive Father died of. The first five years of marriage, my wife and I took care of my parents. Knowing the outcome of my diagnosis has been terrifying! I discovered very quickly that I am in this alone. No one wants to be bothered with someone who is no longer healthy. Social media was my one shot to reconnect with people who I thought might want to rekindle a friendship. I was sadly mistaken. Most just want to know if you became successful, or if you turned out to be a loser. I’m an incredibly strong man. I’ve had to be. I went from being an extremely happy, overly energetic person, to a shell of my former self. What hurts is that no one has even noticed. When tragedy strikes, throngs of people hit the airwaves to offer kindness to total strangers. I could use some that myself! I can deal with being alone. I’ve had no choice. It’s the loneliness that eats at you; knowing that no one cares any longer."
The past two years since my marriage ended have been hell and heartbreak. I really want to be happy and try to stay hopeful but its hard.
"My mom died a month ago, and I feel as if the whole world has continued moving but I’m still stuck in that hospital room with her. It’s a devastating loneliness to watch life happen around you and you’re not able to take part."
"It’s my first year of college. Everybody says that it’s supposed to be the best time of your life. I don’t see how. I had amazing friends at home, and a boyfriend, and I am super close with my mom. I was excited to make new friends here, though. But the people I hang out with I don’t consider my friends. I don’t have any connections with any of them, and I can’t seem to feel that connection with anybody. I feel like there’s something wrong with me. Everybody else here seems to be doing just fine, my hometown friends are excelling in their social lives, the people I’ve been hanging out with all seem to feel that connection with each other. I’m the odd one out. I spend my time studying and alone, as I’d rather spend my time alone than with people I can’t seem to click with. Not a day goes by that I don’t feel lonely."
"The loneliest time in my life was the summer of 1981. It was the summer Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer got married; I was 13 years old. My parents had moved my older brother and me from Toronto to the Cobourg area (about an hour east of Toronto) a couple years before because they decided to pursue their dream of being small business owners and an opportunity in Cobourg presented itself that they couldn’t resist. When we first moved to Cobourg my parents rented houses and in the summer of 1981 we were house sitting for the summer in a rural area just north of Cobourg called Baltimore. My parents were often gone to work before I woke up and didn’t return home before I was already in bed for the night. My brother was old enough to help out with the family business so he was often gone with my parents but there was no place for me at the family business so I was by myself in this strange house for the entire summer. Too young to drive, too far out to walk or ride my bike to visit any friends so I was just stuck there. In the middle of nowhere with nothing to do, no computers or internet or social media back then, we didn’t have any family pets and the lone black and white TV only got three channels. The radio was my only company during those lonely months and I would spend my days singing along and dancing around the house to the songs on the radio. Although I loved the songs at the time (“The Friends of Mr. Cairo” by Jon Anderson of YES and “Gemini Dreams” by The Moody Blues, for example) when I hear those songs now they bring me right back to that lonely summer as a kid and make me incredibly sad. I often change the radio station or just turn it off."
"My mom was recently diagnosed with a very aggressive form of cancer. She’s had surgery and is hopefully now cancer free. But mine and my family’s lives have been consumed by it. I barely saw my parents for a month while my mom was in the hospital. We didn’t want to risk me bringing in a cold or something because it could’ve killed her with her demolished immune system. That being said, I’ve been looking forward to Halloween all year. My dad and I always go all out with the decorations. And even set up a haunted house for little kids. But this year my dad is too busy helping my mom. Normally my friends would come and help in this situation, but they are all much too busy with their lives at the moment. Right now is the longest I’ve gone without seeing them since we met in high school. So I’ve been trying to decorate on my own. Today I cried while holding a skeleton, I feel like I’ve had to grow up in the past two months. I didn’t realize I wasn’t ready to do so..."
"As I sit here writing this, I realize that although I have a girlfriend and a really cool mom, I don’t have anyone I can talk to really. Over the past several months, I have been getting sexually harassed at work by a guy who will turn on a dime and start threatening my job if he ever got the sense that I wasn’t interested in him. As a gay woman, he is far from my type, but I felt like in order to maintain the peace I had to just accept it. I finally went to my manager and told her that was going on and while she was very apologetic, stood by while HR did nothing. He was told not to do it again. I was told to keep it together. Around the same time, I started back to school to work on my doctorate. Going back to school for another degree is difficult enough without dealing with some creep asking to see me naked or trying to find out where I live. I tried to talk to my girlfriend and she told me that I basically needed to not stress about it. Over the course of the past several weeks, things have gotten progressively worse, with an increase in migraines and a vandalized car being the least of my problems. I had to make the decision to drop out of school because of failing grades and all I wanted to do was talk to my girlfriend about it. But I can’t. Because she tells me that I’m too negative and I’m afraid that she’ll leave me if I keep talking to her about the things that are on my mind. I’m surrounded by people but have no one that will give me a second to cry or grieve or whatever I need to do to get through this."
"I left the home, I left her, rented a room. Spent my weekends driving around or listening to the radio in a parking lot in my car, without a home, without a family. Looking back I‘m amazed I survived it. Although my life if much better now, I look forward to meeting someone again and maybe have a family."
"When I realized that the man I was married to was really an alcoholic and he didn‘t want to put his family/children‘s needs above his compulsive drinking, when he told me that he didnt want another child when I was seven months pregnant with my second child, when I realized he was taking money to support his drinking and I was the parent that had to keep telling our kids that we just cant afford whatever it was that they wanted at that time in their lives. I feel the most alone when I realize I was never truly and completely loved and I will never be loved and cherished."
"Loneliness is something I live with most of the time; I only have my partner and dogs for company, so when he goes away on business, which is often, I spend days without speaking or seeing anyone. I long for friendship but I struggle with social anxiety. We moved to a new area a year ago and we don‘t know anyone. At first I tried to join new things so I could meet people, but I started to have panic attacks beforehand and eventually gave up. I find it too stressful to meet people, even people I know, who aren‘t close family or my partner - I worry about being judged and I over analyse every social interaction - its maddening and in some ways being lonely is preferable to the stress. I know I need professional help to overcome this, but that in itself would trigger my social anxiety - so it‘s a hard cycle to escape from."
"Freshman year of high school (a common trope, I know). For weeks at the beginning of the year I would spend my lunches crying in the back bathroom stall, and panic attacks became my only companion. I would try to gag myself so I could go home sick and cry myself to sleep. It doesn‘t help that I‘m gay and I have nobody to confide in. I‘m bursting at the seams. I feel like such a freak, and on top of that, being friendless doesn‘t help either. Im scared to come out because I dont want to be known as the lesbian in an all girls school I guess. You start to feel like there must be something wrong with you. It cant truly be possible to be this lonely if I was a person worth being around. I dont think Ive ever felt so alone."
"My significant other has a big family. A few years ago I was with her at a family event, in a room with probably 30 other people, and I realized I hadn’t spoken a word to anyone in over an hour. I started having a panic attack so I went for a walk to calm down. I just intended to go around the block but wound up walking for close to an hour. I finally came back and no one realized I was gone. I was a background player and no one saw that I left. Pretty sure I could have kept going and never come back, and it would have been no big deal."
"I separated from my partner a couple of years ago. In my determination to get out into the world in those first few months of singledom I decided to go to a theatre production that I really wanted to see but had no one to go with. I told myself that didn‘t matter, proceeded to buy my ticket and travelled to the theatre. Settled into my seat which turned out to be sandwiched between two couples. The production began and although the performances were excellent, I couldn‘t help but feel self conscious when laughing alone at a funny part, with no one to share the reaction with. I ended up leaving at the intermission, rationalizing that I would beat the crowds on the train home. I haven‘t been to the theatre since."
"I feel lonely all the time. Floating in the universe with no one who really gets what I‘m about. I don‘t even get what I‘m about. I know I have time to figure it out, but time either goes too slow or too fast."
"I live in Busan and my life is going to be bored and not natural. People are different culture is unknown. I study here but can not learn anything. I want to make new friends but they can not speak in English, Russian, Uzbek or Turkish. I know I will adopt to Korea and I hope it will not take much time."
"I went from being a well-paid teacher to someone who is trying to exist on the breadline. A year after breaking my leg, my pay reduced to 50% and eventually stopped, so I made the decision to take early retirement which meant living on a very small private pension. At least this gave me an income. The State pension wouldn‘t be available for another 6 years. I thought I could manage with savings. What I hadn‘t considered was how isolated I would become. Everyone important to me were a lot wealthier than I am, enjoying social lives I could no longer afford. I spiralled into a deep depression and didn‘t know how to ask for help. I had spent my life putting others first. Even in depression, I put on an act so not to place my burden onto others. I started to withdraw from social contact, it was easier to stay at home where I could be ‘safe. Also, a lot of the people around me were of the get a grip  response to mental illness. I felt inadequate enough, I didnt need friends telling me to get a grip. Gradually, Ive built up a life with volunteering, looking after my grandchildren, joining groups which cost very little, but, I still feel lonely for that one person who would provide companionship in old age. I feel very vulnerable for the first time in my life!"
"My first week from college. I didn‘t know anyone around, and hence couldn‘t leave the house to have fun somewhere else. I‘m a bit of an introvert, so making friends has always been difficult. Added to the fact that I‘m generally terrified of being outed to a homophobic neighbourhood, it felt especially harder to make new friends. But, we survive. Im talking to a few people now, and am generally trying to live each day as it comes."
New Year‘s Eve from age 16-25.
During hospital stays for my anorexia nervosa. Surrounded by so many lovely people who are just as stuck and alone in their own minds as I am.
"The most lonely moment of my life was when I was standing naked in the shower with my girlfriend and she yelled at me that she would like to punch my fucking face. My girlfriend was raped as a teenager and she couldn‘t cope with men. She loved me but she detested me at the same time. I was standing there naked in the shower, warm water ran over me while being yelled at with threats and all I wanted was to give her a hug and comfort her."
"I lived with people who were only interested in staying indoors. My uni friends just never invited me to do anything with them. I ended up going on a trip to another town and going ice skating alone. I‘m glad I did because that‘s the most fun I had at that time. I‘m still friends with my uni friends, but I‘m now living with new people. The people I live with now actually have an interest in joining me on my adventures. Its much better now."
"We moved from the UK to New Zealand when I was a kid in the 60s, there was a lot of anti-English sentiment back then, I was called “pommy Sue”. My parents were very busy establishing a new life and I wasn’t accepted by the kids at school, I had to get myself ready for school alone and I would come home to an empty house. I wasn’t allowed a pet so I trapped a bird in the garden and kept it in a shed, ostensibly to look after it, after a couple of days it died of fright and I felt incredibly guilty."
"The whole of 2016 I spent alone; I was single after a heavy breakup, I saw my friends maybe only once every two months and I loved it! I had the most productive year towards my music and art, learned and understood new aspects of myself and indulged in pleasures I had been wanting to fer years. It was truly a valuable time in that I learnt that loneliness wasn‘t completely a bad thing, and now I truly treasure the times I have to myself. It‘s made a stronger, more understanding person with greater relationships than I could have ever fathomed. I truly relish those times."
"My mother and grandmother lived together for over 3 decades. I would help them out - all the time - meals, errands, visits. I loved it. My mother died in 2013 - medical error. My grandmother died 6 months later at 96. They gave me a sense of purpose - I loved them so much. I mattered to them. The loss was unimaginable and I never really talked about it with anyone, because it was so big...deep...a piece of me went with them. How do you explain that to someone else? How is such pain conveyed? I dreaded the thought of sharing it with someone only to have them respond with something like...Well one time I had this terrible loss and it was so sad and xyz - at which point I would stop listening and feel worse and wonder how it could be that we humans had come to be such poor communicators. To be heard; to matter - how do we get that back as a species?"
"When I was nine, my tonsils were removed, though I wasn‘t told it would happen. In 1957, anesthetic for children was imprecise, and I awakened flat on my back on the operating room table. Held down. When home, I couldn‘t manage to speak, was severely claustrophobic and nothing seemed real."
"My very first party was freshman year, the day before my 15th birthday. It was a really nice party, actually, with fairy lights and nice people from other schools and a lot of dark beer. And vodka — which I had a preference for. One of my friends felt depressed and I didn‘t want to leave her alone, but I also wanted to keep drinking, so I grabbed a bottle of rose vodka. I guess I felt like that night was supposed to be a rite of passage or something. We walked to this peach tree orchard at the center of our town, only a few blocks away, but by then I was drunk out of my mind. I couldn‘t even walk, I kept stumbling into fire hydrants. The last thing I remember from that night was shrieking, “I love you!” to her half-sickened-half-concerned face. I woke up the next morning at like 3 am and it was horrible, the worst I‘ve ever felt in my whole life. All my friends and a few strangers were sleeping in the next room over and I was in some guy‘s shirt because my friend didn‘t have any clothes that fit me. And it was my birthday. I stumbled over to her couch and sat on it and the world was just so quiet. Suddenly, I was 15 years old and hungover and everything hurt because I was scraped-up. There were thorns in my feet because I‘d walked barefoot places. I‘ve never felt so alone in my life. I wanted to be held so badly. For someone to tell me that it was okay, to stop crying, even wish me a happy birthday. I felt so small and afraid. I put my hands between my thighs and just kept looking at my toes and how chipped up my coral nail polish was even though I‘d got them done with my mom the day before. I remember all of this viscerally. The morning stars, the silent TV, and me. Nobody comforted me when they woke up finally, obviously, besides a few comments about how scared people got when my pulse began to stutter. I don‘t think they knew it was my birthday either, so I got no birthday wishes. But that didnt hurt so much. What hurt was when my mom picked me up. My mom‘s very principled about these things. I think she could tell what happened the moment I got into the car because I reeked of vodka. She didn‘t speak to me at all for the entire day. She‘s usually the one who buys cake and stuff, who gets really happy about birthdays. She canceled the big dinner we were supposed to have that night with all our family friends without telling me. That was the first time we didn‘t really celebrate. My dad didnt say anything to me either. It was like I was blanked out for that whole day. No one could even look at me. That was the loneliest Ive ever felt — when I everyone I loved made me feel like I didn‘t exist, made me feel like I was repulsive and not worth anything. It was my fault and I probably deserved it, but it still made me feel so awful and alone. That no one would forgive me or at least held me with such unconditional positive regard that they could look past this mistake for one day, that day, my birthday — it hurt so much. Anyways, I still can‘t eat anything that tastes of rosewater."
The first time his symptoms were bad enough to keep us housebound for several days.
"I feel lonely most nights when I am in bed. When all I want is to cuddle someone and feel loved and to feel seen and held. It is hard to explain. But I am not into the gay scene and I don‘t identify with that scene at all. But this means I rarely ever meet other likeminded gay men. I am not obviously gay to other people, who always assume I am straight. It means I am left to use apps like Grindr. Grindr is a place where loneliness is abundant. Where people seek a quick fix to there current feeling of isolation and loneliness.It makes me so fearful for my future. How will I ever meet someone, how will I ever find love, that deep meaningful connection, where that one special person sees you in your entirety, the good and the bad and accepts it wholeheartedly and loves me for who I am. That person who is there to dream my dreams with me and hold me when they don‘t work out. That person who will be there as my health fails, that person who will walk the dark paths with me as well as the light ones.I have so much to offer and sometimes I feel like a balloon filling up to the point I will burst. To me, living in a world that places people on boxes, straight, gay or whatever, makes me feel like I don‘t belong and I will not ever meet the man who could walk alongside me in life. To me loneliness is a poverty of opportunity to meet that someone. It is looking around at all my friends and seeing them dating and falling in love and feeling left behind."
"I felt the most lonely a few months ago, when I found out my partner had been seeing other people. Suddenly I couldn‘t trust him any more, and I realised that by focusing on our relationship I had isolated myself from the few friends i‘d had. He on the other hand, had an ever growing network of friends, that I of course was not welcome to be a part of. I‘d been so content on being the perfect girl for him, that he would always want to be with, that I didnt even realise he was taking advantage of my kindheartedness, as well as gas-lighting and subtly controlling me. Im still in that relationship, because I have nowhere else to go, and dont have the mental or financial capability to be on my own."
"When I went through 3rd grade being bullied, picked on, and excluded. Then I moved. 4th grade would be so much better, I thought – but by the end of it, I only had one friend. By the end of 5th grade, she had betrayed me and left me lonely yet again. In 6th grade, I finally found a friend group. In 7th grade, all but two of my friends left me because I was annoying and also a lesbian – and in the second half of the year, those two decided to ditch me for a month just to see what happened. In 8th grade, my remaining two friends ditched me for good. Now I’m starting 9th grade and I have no one. I’m done being optimistic. I’m done telling myself this year will be better than the last. I’ve given up. I think this is the loneliest I’ve ever felt."
"My sister-in-law, who had lived with me for years, and knows me well moved out recently and now I have no one to talk to. But the worst was when my adult sons grew up and left home because I loved cooking for my family. Now it‘s a struggle to feed myself. One son lives hours away and the other is busy with two jobs and two kids."
"I was on a vacation with friends in Europe and planned to spend my last week solo, mulling around and just enjoying the last of my vacation before starting a new job. In reality I spent 2 days walking around a city pretending to be just another tourist while internally I was more lost than ever before. On the third day I purchased a one-way ticket home (a week ahead of my original flight home) and spent 24 hours travelling embarrassed and anxious because I didn‘t know how I was going to explain my change in plans. To this day I have never told another person the real reason I came home early, that I couldn‘t handle the crushing reality of how alone I felt. Instead I lied and told everyone I was always the plan to finish my vacation at home. "
"One evening I was stood up by my boyfriend and he didn‘t reply to my phone calls or my messages and my kids were with their father and I came home to an empty house and sat on the steps and realized the depth of the void inside me. I think I sat with my mouth gaping, incredulous at the profundity of my loneliness. It shattered the image I have of myself as independent emotionally and self-sufficient generally. It made me realize that I attempt to fill the hole with lovers but that I need to learn to fill it with self-love.

Which sounds so cheesy, I know, and ultimately if we‘re social creatures we can‘t simply rely on ourselves for overcoming feelings of loneliness, no?

I thought I would have figured this all out by 50!"
"I’ve been in a loving lesbian relationship for over a year but haven’t come out to my parents. So i’m having to spend Christmas this year away from her and her children, who are my world, to spend it with my family. It is so lonely to have this whole other amazing world that I can’t even talk about because of my parents close mindedness. I feel like I have to hide away all the best parts of my life and pretend to be an entirely different person. On a holiday that is supposed to be spent with loved ones and showing how much you care about them, i’m spending it with people who don’t even really know me. I’m a stranger in a room full of people i’ve known my entire life."
"I was at church. There are plenty of people who are my age, and after over a year of attending, I have not felt welcomed by them. No one spoke to me. I held back tears during service."
"I‘m single. Have no children even though I always wanted to be a mother. But I didn‘t feel I could do it alone. And I never found the right partner. Getting up in the morning and facing the day, and facing people – all married or divorced with children, or planning for a life like that. Knowing that I dont fit in. It takes courage every day to go to my job and out into the world, as myself – a single, childless woman. Im lucky enough to have finally found a job that I love, and my coworkers are very kind. I dont think they judge me. But on weekends and vacations I feel lost, weighed down by the stretches of unaccounted for time. When I go back to work after a weekend, I almost feel like Im recovering from an illness – slow and disorganized. Then the cycle starts all over again the following weekend. I hate holidays. I hate being a tag-along to someone elses celebration, hate being invited places out of pity, and also suffer when I spend a holiday by myself. Even when Im with my family, Im the odd one out. Watching way too much Netflix and Hulu over here in this particular apartment."
"When I found out I was pregnant I was so happy, but as my pregnancy progressed I realized, no one else is going to defend and fight for my child, no one else is going to take an interest in all his little milestones, no one else will be there through the monotony of the day. I never understood that motherhood could be so lonely until my second trimester."
This year in general. I’ve felt a lot better than I have in passed years but sometimes I still feel a recurring feeling of isolation. I have friends but in an age of rising technology there seems to be a big disconnect from reality sometimes. I feel like my relationships have gotten significantly worse as technology continues to progress. There’s never any time to have conversations anymore. Everyone always has something to do or somewhere to be and I am here watching it through a tiny screen. Loneliness is a persistent feeling that resonates throughout the whole body and sometimes it feels like there is no way to stop it from consuming you.
Hearing love songs. I physically can’t have sex so I can’t even do something as small as relating to a song. If I can’t have sex then I can’t have a boyfriend let alone a family. I wish I could see into my future and know if things will get better.
I was recently separated from my child’s father. I had an empty house for the first time in over a year. It was the first time I was truly alone since the birth of my daughter.
"When I was in my third year of medical school. I had lived in that country for 4 yrs, I was 25 yrs old, I had never had a boyfriend, I wasn’t seeing anyone at that time. I had very rough days and I looked forward with desperation to Fridays. I would enjoy being on the crowded buses because of the human touch I would experience as others brushed by me. But when I got off the bus and climbed the steps to my room on hall, I realized I had nothing to do, no one to call and nothing I could have truly been looking forward to. I would cry myself to sleep each time and then repeat the whole thing again the following week."
I once felt particularly lonely when I was home alone and thought about all the other people around the world that for a multitude of reasons felt similarly at that moment. I believe people around the world are fundamentally the same in that we just want to love and be loved. The recognition of the absence of love in my life that evening gave me a profound sense of loneliness.
Most certainly after a serious break up. Sometimes there aren‘t perfect words to say or hear from the support of your family and friends. The best mechanism to this when I experience a romantic heartbreak is that I‘ve learned to depend on myself the most. Tons of self reflection and introspection helps me process my wounds and heal internally; which inevitably uplifts my external world as well.
"The night I walked out of the hospital alone, after hearing mum‘s diagnosis. I barely made it to my car, before I completely broke down. I sat there alone in the freezing cold and cried, until I had no tears left."
"Last night I played with a new band with mostly young people. They were making plans to go to the pub. I went home, drank wine and wrote emails. Most of these emails are friendly and thoughtful, but I never send them. Last night I wrote to my daughter who rarely calls unless she needs money. She‘s dealing with some serious mental health problems and I‘m pretty sure she got them from me."
When my father and I got into an argument and he told me I wasn‘t worth 10 bucks.
"My freshman year of college is the loneliest I have ever been. I was a poor hispanic girl from a small suburb at a school for wealthy white kids from big cities, and I felt incredibly isolated. The school was notorious for being painfully cold and unwelcoming, but I didn‘t care. I wanted to be a writer and at the time, it seemed like the only way. I didn‘t make many friends, I was too depressed to function, and the friendships that I had spent my whole life building back home were crumbling before my eyes. The least lonely I ever felt at that college was at group therapy. It was a rough year."
The day before I left and flew thousands of miles back home. When everything had failed. I took a picture of you sleeping on that lazy boy chair you loved. You looked so peaceful. I knew that would be the last photo I’d ever take of you and all the years of memories came rushing back. It was that moment I knew that I was alone. I’d lost you and you’d lost me.
"I met him via an online game called Trivia Crack. It’s similar to Trivial Pursuit. He said “hello” and I said “good game, shall we play again?” We continued to challenge each other for a while before I asked him where he was from, “Washington, D.C.” he said. He asked me, “Australia” I replied. He became intrigued as he hadn’t spoken to an Australian before. We spoke every day thereafter, exchanging numbers and Instagram handles. Before I knew it, I was head-over-heels for a man who lived over 11,000 miles away. I arrived in Washington, D.C. on the 31st of October 2016, 15 months after the first hello. I had just spent a month touring America, having met amazing people along the way and feeling accepted. The tour continued to New York however I departed and checked myself in at an AirBnB in Potomac, Maryland, recommended by the man of whom I had fallen for. No set plans had been made however he advised me that his mother was in hospital, he was stressed, it wasn’t good timing. I’d send a text message asking if he wanted to do this, wanted to do that though he never replied. I spent a lot of time in bed. I watched YouTube, which created an illusion of company. I dragged myself to Macy’s in the afternoon and browsed the department store alone, occasionally asking customer representatives where to locate an item, just to prove I wasn’t invisible, to feel alive for a moment. I took myself to the cinema and ate popcorn alone. I dined out alone. I drunk at a hotel bar alone. Occasionally we’d speak on the phone and I begged him to meet me, excuses were given. Sometimes I was given false hope, so I’d make an appointment at a beauty counter and have my make-up professionally applied, only to fall asleep at an ungodly hour having wasted my evening waiting to hear from him. I felt so utterly alone. I realised how alone I was when I continued to make appointments to have my make-up professionally applied, the beauty technician was polite and we’d share a conversation, general chit chat. Sometimes this was the only interaction I experienced all day. I felt worthless. I felt as if I was not worth his time nor effort. It was now the 18th of November 2016 and I spent the majority of my last day in a park watching squirrels and their behaviour. After a few final purchases and sights that had to be seen, the time had come to take myself to the airport. It was two hours before boarding and he had promised he would call so we could chat before I departed. One hour passed and I patiently waited, my anxiety level rose. I checked the time, thirty minutes until boarding and still nothing. I hid myself in a corner, called him and left a teary voice message. It was time to board and with wet eyes I showed my passport and ticket. As I was sitting down in my seat on the aeroplane, he rung. I sobbed, an air hostess asked if I was okay and I mouthed to her “saying goodbye”. She nodded and gave me a hot towel for my face, her kind gesture only caused me to sob more. The phone connection disintegrated and I was asked to switch off my mobile. Sometimes I question my decisions, the actions directed by a heart worn on the sleeve.The choices made by an individual can brutally effect others, I don’t think I’ve ever felt more alone in my life. In October, it will be two years since I was stood up and to this day I still cry over how I was treated, the lack of respect, the lack of answers, the silence."
"When I crossed the finish line of my first marathon for my 26th birthday out of state, I realized that no one would be around to be proud of me. Other marathoners had family, spouses, or significant partners waiting and when I crossed it was silent. Many people had gone home because it was a small race and I‘m not a fast runner. I grabbed my medal and went to my hotel room, alone, as though my biggest athletic feat that I‘d trained for months and months to achieve...had never happened. I posted it on Facebook, but the likes will never be the real thing. "
Always around the holidays. It always sucks as I don‘t have anyone to be with. I haven‘t had a romantic relationship in forever.
"My most lonely is currently. I‘ve always been a slightly sickly person, but the summer of 2016 it got ramped up to 11. I lost my job, I was vomiting blood, and a bunch of other gross stuff. I was weak, exhausted. I‘ve gotten my main diagnosis, but there is no cure, just gradual decline and decay. At Christmas this year, my favorite uncle (who only sees me once a year) uncomfortably said hello & then spent 5 hrs avoiding me with my other uncle. This man and I used to talk for hours because he genuinely enjoyed my views and opinions, and how he won‘t be in the same room as me. It made me step back and realize that all my friends have basically acted like Homer Simpson in the gif where he slowly steps back letting the shrubs engulf him. Even my ‘best friend who used to be my patient advocate at times and check on me daily... I hadnt seen her in 4 months and the only time she talks to me is if she needs to vent because she knows Im around. Im lonely because an illness I didnt ask for, that is killing me, has left me homebound and uncomfortable to look at because it took too long for the doctors to catch it. Aside from when my boyfriend gets home from work, I spend my day entirely alone. And most of his time after work is running errands and cooking and picking up the slack so... still alone. Alone and a burden."
"Whenever I make a mistake. I feel unforgivable, as if any chance I stood of being loved fades to black."
"I felt the most lonely when I had my first panic attack due to my anxiety, but felt I had no one to tell about it. It was an absolutely terrifying experience. I didn’t know what was wrong with me. I was too scared to ask for help, and instead of reaching out to others I started to separate myself from every “friend” I had and my anxiety began to consume me."
"I started drinking alcohol for the first time in my life. I broke religious and community barriers, that was crazy."
There comes a time when you’ve retired and your kids find excuses not to hang out with you. When I was their age there was an energy and vibrancy to everything. You wanted to fill every moment with friends and activities. I’d spend time with my parents regularly as a kind of obligation but not so much quality one on one time. Wouldn’t invest the kind of spontaneity I gave to my friends and peers. I suppose that’s the way of things. I never gave a second thought as to whether my busy schedule pained my parents the way it pains me now. I might have made more of an effort.
"When my marriage ended and I was up at the cottage we rented every summer, and my daughter was away at camp. I was heartbroken and utterly alone. I journalled my days to survive it. Here is an actual excerpt: 7:10 trying to get out of bed. 7:20 am out of bed making coffee. 745 back in bed. 810 crying on floor in bathroom. 8:30 made myself go for a walk. Saw falcon. 10:00 how many hours until bedtime and this day is over? Being alone at Christmas that year was a close second."
"One of my first sleepovers in fourth grade. At that age a lot of kids are finding their sexual orientation and talking about crushes and such. As per usual truth or dare came about and the most asked truth- who do you have a crush on. If you answered no one you were pushed til you let out an answer, but for me the answer was genuinely no one. Honestly, I felt a deep sadness inside me, I had a feeling that I would forever be alone and never find myself. Instead of showing my true self, I decided to pick a random kid in our class and go on with life and girls thinking I liked this boy. I felt out of place, not accepted for myself. In around 7th grade, I found the terms asexual and aromantic. While it was reliving to find myself, I still have to put on a persona everytime that dreaded question comes up or whenever my aunts and uncles come over and ask when I‘ll have a boyfriend."
"It was a Saturday night and I was in bed. I’d had a bad week, having it been really busy plus I’d Also messaged a guy I was interested in earlier in the week but there had been no response. Saturday nights, late in bed are the hardest. I was sad because he hadn’t replied and then I started to think of the fact that he was gone and that there was no one else and from there my thoughts spiralled out of control until I was crying and I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I sat up in bed, trying to catch my breath, tears streaming down my face until I finally relaxed. Since that night, I vowed to never get too disheartened about my singleness. To never get too attached to a person so that I didn’t have to feel this way again. This year has been a good year and most the time I’m okay, but when the loneliness sneaks in, it’s hard to shake. I’m still on a path to accept that maybe me being single is how it’s supposed to be right now and I think about it everyday, but I’m learning to sit with the loneliness and accept that it’s okay to be lonely, but really, you’re never alone."
"Moving to Las Vegas with my husband (then boyfriend). He was offered a job and I had just graduated so I didn’t hesitate to come with him. I’d had surgery before the move so I would be unable to do anything for some time after. I decided to leave my cats and resolved to get them at a later time, and brought my ferret. We moved on a Saturday, and by Monday she was not doing well. She passed away later that night, after only 3 days, and I don’t think I ever felt so lonely in my life (it really was just a coincidence as she was older, but the timing couldn’t have been worse). My husband would be off at work all day, and I was stuck in a 1 bedroom apartment by myself all day until he came home. I sat alone all day with no one to talk to, nowhere to go, and I couldn’t even unpack any boxes because I’d just had surgery. Everyone I knew but my husband were all still back at home, across a state line in California. They were living their lives, going to work and socializing and hanging out with friends while I sat in my quiet apartment, lonely and feeling sorry for myself. The silence was deafening, and was the most honest and truthful thing I’ve ever heard. It has become easier to be alone, and in fact I sometimes prefer it. But sometimes the loneliness comes with it and it comes crashing down hard and even the radio or my favorite music does nothing. Even in a room full of people I know or are at least familiar with, I still feel lonely much of the time. I suppose it’s just part of my makeup now, imbued in my DNA"
"Not connecting on a deeper, fundamental level with someone. Having to hold back who you truly are. To me that is when I’m at my most lonely. I am trapped alone in my head with my thoughts unable to share with anyone else."
"As a stay at home mom it comes with the territory. I know I chose this but I also didn’t really have the option to go back out into the world after. Every day being alone takes a toll on you mentally, you have your online mom groups but it’s just not the same."
I truly do not remember. Too many years without emotional support except for the professional kind. Right now I am dealing with the recent death of my mom. I am really taking a closer look at grief and how it feels to me. I am trying to write it down. Grief is very lonely.
"One of my oldest friends was sleeping with the person I was in love with behind my back and then didn’t have the guts to tell me, so I found out from my lover. The week my terminal project for grad school was due. Suffice it to say, it took me another year to graduate. It took months to recover from the feeling that I really couldn’t trust anyone; even my closest friends, and that people didn’t care about me enough to think about how their behavior might hurt me. I’m mostly better now. It’s been 11 years and my mind still brings it up as a reason not to trust that people will really be there for me when I need them. That I am alone in the world and always will be.

All that said, I am with a wonderful person who loves me dearly and we’re happily planning to spend the rest of our lives together. But the feeling of loneliness never goes away, and there is always a nagging thought in my mind that I will die alone and forgotten in the streets. (I know, rationally, that there are people in my life who would never let that happen, but that knowledge doesn’t make the feeling go away.)"
When my one true friend who knew my life inside out passed away. She was my safe place.
"Standing on the driveway the day one of my brothers moved to the US for university. My family is insanely close and still are, despite my parents being divorced. That said, when the person who I could relate to most in the world moved away I was terrified. I was so happy for him and his new chapter but felt insanely lonely. I was 23. My parents split at 22. We decided (my two brothers and I) that no matter what we’d always be there for each other. I am the oldest and was left in Toronto with the youngest. I didn’t know how to relate to him or open up to him because we (as a family) always protected him from the ugliness of reality. I think ultimately my loneliness came from guiltiness (I didn’t know how to relate to my youngest brother) and selfishness (I didn’t want to face my parents divorce alone)."
Every single Mother’s Day since 2005.
I broke my ankle and didn’t see anyone besides my husband for weeks at a time. I could stave off the loneliness at my job but literally trapped in bed 24 hours a day was soul-crushing.
I was sleeping alone in the guest bedroom of a friend’s house. I could hear her and her boyfriend laughing. I knew I was going to bed alone while they had each other. It made me feel so lonely.
"By far, when I was sexually assaulted by a stranger in broad daylight in 2014. That was the first trauma i personally experienced and it was just after my first year of college. I was not sure of who I was at the time and was in a period where i was losing touch with high school friends and struggling to make friends in college in a program I did not enjoy very much. The people I was close to did not know how to help me through that experience, which made me feel lonelier than ever."
"I developed an eating disorder at the age of 15. When I was 20, my parents found out about my problem and over the next year, I attended a drop-in group therapy program in order to appease them. I wasn’t ready to give up my coping mechanism or dig into my trauma at that time, so I basically just got better at hiding my eating disorder, which continued to control and haunt my daily life for many years to come. At age 27, I was finally fed up of having my life controlled by food and exercise, and I started attending an intensive holistic therapy program at a well-respected center in Toronto. I saw a team of specialists 2-3 times a week over a period of 4 months, and eventually tapered my treatment to single weekly therapy sessions. I worked hard as hell to dig into the key causes of my eating disorder, including sexual trauma and an emotionally abusive upbringing, both which resulted in anxiety, substance abuse, and compulsive behaviour problems. I am privileged and fortunate to have had access to the program that eventually allowed me to heal from my eating disorder, but it came with a huge price. That summer, as a student, I used a student line of credit and OSAP to pay for the $14,000 of treatment I received. None of it was covered by the government or my limited student healthcare benefits. Despite an ongoing rocky and tumultuous relationship with my parents, I reached out to them for help paying for my treatment, but they said no. Since eating disorders are still so stigmatized, and because I’ve always prided myself on being independent, I was ashamed to reach out to anyone else for help. I still struggle to this day to make ends meet, but I’ve managed to get by, and now that I only have one more year of school left, there is light at the end of the tunnel. I know deep down that I’ll be okay and somehow find a way to make it through. I am resourceful as hell, and I’ll figure it out. But it really hurts that the people who should’ve been there for me more than anyone else in the world simply weren’t. Thankfully, due to my therapy work, I now know that my parents’ lack of support isn’t a reflection of my worth, and is instead a result of their own personal trauma and hurt. I’ve built myself up in the ways that my parents never did, and put loving people around me who make me feel supported and seen and valued. Working through my eating issues gave me the foundation to be able to finally face my sexual trauma, which has allowed me to be able to reconnect fully with my body and learn to love and care for it. I still get sad when I think about my relationship with my parents. I have effectively cut them off for the past 2 years, but for now I know it’s better than the alternative. I don’t think I could have done the healing over the last 2 years that I did if I was still in contact with them. By disconnecting from something destructive, I was finally able to start connecting with myself and my life."
"I felt lonely when my father and brother has to leave the country and i stayed in Jordan with my mom, it was a week full of grief but I got over it with some friends."
"Moving abroad five years ago began the most lonely period of my life. I knew I had to pursue something that I couldn’t find at home, so I left behind friends and family to do it. I looked forward to meeting scads of new incredible people but that hasn’t panned out. It’s me, my work, and a seemingly endless chain of frustrated attempts to cultivate intimacy. Have I made the wrong decision? Should I go back home and have close friends, but no career or sense of purpose? I find that I can’t."
"The loneliest I’ve ever felt was when I realized that the love of my life didn’t want to spend time with me. To put that much power on another person, any person really, is a choice though. It’s as if I had this expectation that if another human being actively sought me out, I would feel validated as a person myself. I’ve since come to realize (or possible delude myself into thinking) that loneliness is simply a feeling of low self esteem. When I am with others that care to have conversations with me, I feel worthy. I’m currently working on my perspective of self worth."
The loneliest I’ve ever felt was when my marriage hit a very dark patch and I thought my husband and I were going to divorce.
"I threw a going away party – a huge, crazy fun one, and only 6 or 7 people showed up of the 40+ I had invited. And that’s when I realised I had spent so much time chasing quantity in friends after all of those years alone that I had somehow ended up lonelier than before."
"I’m sitting with some of my friends and that day everyone is talking about the latest gossip of a girl getting together with a boy. I tried to ask a question about them, as I really didn’t know what was going on. Everyone laughs and is like “oh it’s nothing.” They go back to talking and a couple minutes later, a girl says Why are you so smart Ree. You can’t hang with us if you are. To bad you have no idea what’s going on. Clearly you aren’t as smart as everyone says”. That was like a punch in the stomach. I’ve always been the ‘smart kid‘, but I didn’t realize it had put me so far apart. Now, no matter who I try to talk to, I know that there’ll always be that loneliness in me, because I had yet to find another soul who understood me."
"It was when my ex married someone after only six months of knowing her. Before that I was with him for 10 years, even had a child together. It makes me feel so alone, and often makes me wonder if he truly did love me. It’s been 3 years since our separation, and even though things got bad at the end of our relationship, I know I still love him. What tore me up was they just recently got a cat that resembles the one he inherited from his deceased uncle, and became my cat so to speak. He was my therapy cat, and is no longer alive. My ex for some reason today told me the cat that him and his wife got is the ghost of our other one. Sounds stupid, but it tore me up inside. He knew how much I loved that cat, and just picturing them picking out a family pet together makes me feel so alone that I no longer am a part of his life. Also, not even sure wtf his intention was telling me that."
"Sorry, this is long. To me, loneliness is when you are surrounded by people and they see you and you see them, but no one really ponders each other’s presence. People see you as just some colored blur in the background that they’ll never have a want or need to interact with. To them, you’re just another prop. This also tends to be vice-versa. This realization hit me kinda hard, that every stranger you see is just another person you pass by in the daily stream of people, and chances are you’ll never see them again. You’ll never learn what their name is, what their favorite color is, what foods they enjoy etc. And that’s exactly what you are to them as well. Every person you walk past or glance at has a life that is just as, if not more, complex than your own. I was 9 when I noticed this and it freaks me out to this day. I remember sitting in those little chairs and staring at the teachers and suddenly wanting to know more about his wife and his son. I wanted to know the hobbies and interests of the kids in the class across the hall. I stared at everyone with eyes the size of dinner plates. Third grade was crazy, man.Sorry, this is long.

"I’ve felt lonely many times, mostly because I never felt like I belong here. Having Asperger’s doesn’t help either, and I only knew I had it a couple of years ago. Until college I was never invited to parties or any other social meetings. Once I tried to get together with old high-school friends only to realize that I had virtually none, as only one of them showed up with her (now ex-) husband. Later I learnt that the other people I invited were actually at another meeting. A much more popular person had a birthday party which of course I was never invited to."
"This is another circumstance, this is my hometown when I get back, meet people and they never ask about me, but for my sister to me."
"Moving into my new apartment, I had to organize my belongings all by myself and realized I had nothing to unpack represent my relationships, friendships and social existence. It was a realization that I have not shared my life story with another person.
TELL ME THE STORY OF THE TIME YOU FELT THE MOST LONELY.
Every day I go down to the cafeteria at work and find it difficult to locate an empty table to eat at by myself. Groups of co-workers sit together socializing and sharing their daily experiences. All the tables seat 4 people and I feel guilty when I do find one taking up all the space by myself. I have this tone to my presence that emulates leave me alone, I don‘t want anyone to sit here. I find solace in my own quiet moments. I don‘t have to talk and find peace in my isolation. It lingers for some time until I see a group laughing or debating some verbal topic I can‘t make out being too far away. The envy passes and I remind myself anonymity is better than having to fake being interested. Is this selfish? I don‘t have interest in hearing about other people‘s problems or drama. In those moments it reminds me what lonely really is. The burden of others’ issues is exactly why I make this conscious decision to eat alone."
"I was having a pretty rough time with school and soccer (I had a major soccer tournament coming up the next week and it was going to be my last since I was graduating, and my team hasn‘t been in our best condition). I told my parents about it, they replied with: so stop playing. It broke my heart because in front of their friends they would boast about me playing but in times like these, that was like emotional betrayal. I later came to the conclusion that I can‘t count on them for emotional support."
"We were doing Christmas shopping because I pushed for it. I left my home country almost 2 years ago and I still have a hard time calling this place home. I moved here because of my husband. He grew up here. I think he feels safe here. Anyway. I have probably two friends here. No coworkers. No family other than our pets. I pushed to go Christmas shopping for his coworkers and our two friends. I started crying when I walked past the toy section at the store. I remembered how much I enjoyed going shopping for the coolest toys for my nephews. I love giving gifts to people and it’s not completely selfless... I love to see their reaction when they see what I got them. To know that I surprised them and made them smile...it means so much to me. And then it hit me. I have no one here. I can’t do shopping for them because it’s virtually impossible for me to get the stuff there later. It made me really sad. I missed the toy hunting, but more than anything, I miss having my people with me. I feel terribly alone."
"When my mom called some people dumb and disgusting just because they’re gay and it really got me because, I, her own daughter is a gay woman. The woman I thought will understand me the most turned out to be the wrong person."
"When I scrolled through my instagram feed and saw pictures of girls I considered my best friends having parties without me, of course with big smiles and fun captions like “Love my besties sooo much????” and “sisters for life”. I cried for hours. Where was I in all this? Was I not good enough? Was I too fat, annoying, ugly, or stupid? What was wrong with me? I wondered. High school is only two years away, but to me it sounds like a paradise that I can’t reach. All I hear is how wonderful high school is and how I’ll make all my friends there. I honestly can’t wait any longer for it. I’m kind of hoping for a high school heaven."
"Very recently, I realized that every member of my family was not the same person I knew growing up anymore. After my parents got divorced, I shoved all of my emotions to a vault in the back of my head...and it wasn’t until I went away from home and to school that all of them came rushing back. For a while, it left me more numb than before...but then it evolved into an all encompassing loneliness. My dad is a member of a religion which discourages communication with non-members, and he does not support me or my decision to go to college in favor of religion, and refuses to speak with me. My mother and brother both have substance abuse issues, mostly with prescription drugs and alcohol. It’s hard to feel like I have any family left.

However, I’ve tried seeing it this way: your family does not have to be the family you were born into. I’m trying my best to find family in the incredible people who have helped me along the way."
"My mother died when I was 38 after a short illness. We had shared an apartment together and then I was on my own. For really the first time in my life. I didn’t realize how much I did for her or how much my life was connected to her life. I lost my way and lost my purpose for being. I struggled for a long time trying to find meaning in life and my purpose for still being here. I knew when she was alive that my happiness revolved around making my mother happy. I have always found making other people happy has made me happy. I struggled with suicide and sought out professional help. I found it didn’t really help me. I ended up going to a naturopath who listened and did acupuncture and that helped. Also, I determined that I needed help and finally asked my friends for help. When I had a bad day I would call a friend and talk. The hardest part was asking friends for help but was the start of my recovery. I learned that I want to be here and that I can make other people happy. And that helping other people is a great focus. I volunteer in my town and try to help charities. I also help my friends and family. I have found purpose and in doing so found myself and happiness. So now I share my struggles with others to know that they are never alone. Always someone there to help. Just have to reach out and ask."
"It was after my dog had died. She had been sick for months, but she had been recovering. Slowly, but surely. One day, I was walking her at night, and she leaped over the porch stairs as we were going home. She was going too fast for me, so I pushed the button on the retractable leash. She tripped, hitting her leg against the bricks. Her health plummeted, and I still haven’t forgiven myself. I cried myself to sleep for months, and I felt so guilty. I never told anyone this. They just assumed I was sad she had died, and I didn’t want them to blame me again. I hated myself so much."
"My fiancé and I had a long distance relationship for a year and a half. I always made the trip and subsequently the effort for us to be together. I moved to be with him. We had a baby and got engaged. For the last five months he’s been working out of town, home every second weekend for 48 hours. We had no idea it would be so hard for us – we had managed a LDR for so long. But we’re unable to cope this time around. He rarely calls, texts to ask about our child. And when he’s home he tries to swing back into our normal lives and we both fall flat. I feel like he has no consideration for what I go through, being alone. I just want his empathy. I moved for him. And he left anyways. I feel like a child complaining. But my heart aches."
"Being diagnosed with cancer when you’re 16 is the loneliest experience on earth. You’re under 18, so you’re still treated in the children’s ward. But you’re not 5, and the books, toys and decorations in the ward don’t appeal. No one in the hospital is your age – they’re either very young or over 50ish. Your friends and your boyfriend stop talking to you. You spend more days than you can count in a hospital room with the door closed and the blinds drawn. You feel so physically awful so it’s not like you can run away, and there isn’t a single person on earth that you can relate to. You are 16 and you are facing deep depression, loneliness, and death, all on your own. I’ve never felt more lonely in my entire life."
"The most recent time, I hitch hiked across the country to Haida Gwaii, BC with two friends. We parted ways on a bad note in Alberta, and I continued on by myself. I was feeling pretty low the whole trip thus far. Haida Gwaii is already about 6 hours of ferry off of the mainland. I was suddenly in the most beautiful, ancient forest I had ever set foot in, but was struggling to enjoy myself, as I was faced with a lot of why I had wanted to leave home in the first place."
"I felt the most lonely the day my husband of 32 years died and I went to sleep in our bed without him beside me. That was 2 years ago and I still feel lonely every time I come home and close the door behind me and realize it’s just me. All the things my husband and I did together before I now do alone. Even the most mundane things like going grocery shopping, having a cup of tea, watching a favorite show on television remind me that he‘s not here to do these things with. He made everything fun and could always make me laugh. Without him I feel lost. It’s as though I‘m just floating around in limbo."
"Pre-breakup phase of my relationship. I was having all these doubts and feelings within myself. I wasn’t happy. I knew I couldn’t give him the happiness he deserved. The relationship became stale, and slowly I started to resent him. In the 5 years we have been together I feel I was only there for him, and not for myself. When the rotary ribfest came to town, I went down to it with some recently made friends. One in particular I have been speaking with for awhile. We knew each other as kids, but that was it. Eventually we met again in the last few months, and rekindled. He became my outlet for trying to understand how it was I was feeling. I didn’t want to accept that this was happening to me. After I said bye to my friends I walked down to the secluded area of the lake. I sat there and I felt so alone. I cried, I cried a lot. Coming to the understanding of feeling alone in a relationship is one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do, along with ending it. We try so hard to please our partners, but when you seemingly do everything for them and none for yourself, you lose yourself. It’s hard to find yourself. I’m extremely thankful to have my friend back in my life to help me understand what it is I’m feeling because I’ve lost myself so badly that I can’t even determine it."
"When my pet rabbit died, I just realized she was meant everything to me. Without her, I seem just all alone and now I have to face to the truth that ‘I am all alone‘ ."
"Getting through the rut of life, making sure everything is going smoothly. Life is so busy, work, home, kids, husband. But no friend. Everyone is busy. I go out to malls and coffee shops, when kids are at school, free time, sipping coffee all by myself, watching people come and go but none recognizable, no one to talk to. It’s been so long, I’ve forgotten how to make friends, forgotten what to talk about, gotten used to my solitude - actually not, still hoping. At home, hubby is so busy with work and life troubles that he’s always in pensive thought in front of the TV. Doesn’t care if I put on a special perfume, or eyeliner, wear a new dress or part my hair different way..... That’s not even on his agenda - as long as food is served to him. And he passes out in front of the television due to his hectic day and tiredness. My role as a single mother to my kids including hubby, single caretaker of the home, and support to my family is compared to a tree giving shade to all, bearing fruits and making them strong but lonely inside. Desperately need a friend to chill out but don’t know how."
"The time I felt the most lonely was when I was 16 and my mom found out I was gay. She cried for 3 hours, made me pray to ask God to change me, made me watch homophobic sermons, told me I was going to hell and that I ruined her dreams of becoming a missionary. I stayed in my room the whole day and cried. None of my three siblings came to check on me or asked me if I was ok. I could hear them laughing outside of my room door, ignoring my pain. I had no friends to call or to vent to. I had myself and all I could do was cry."
"I remember in highschool, I associated a friend with my loneliness, if I was lonely I’d just think of him and it would all be okay. It was as simple as creating a fantasy and setting up the narrative. It became addicting that I ended up using it for years. The year that followed, I had a falling out with my friend and I had to leave the country. It was on the plane that I was most lonely as I looked back on the past 4 years of my life, all I saw was that I wasted my time on fantasies instead of making real bonds and the few friends I had managed to have, were now gone since I wasn’t planning on going back."
The time I felt the most lonely was after my best friend had gotten married. I realized her now husband has replaced me as her best friend.
"I feel lonely for some reasons people think are stupid. I met a boy two summers ago, unfortunately we only had 9 days together but something happened to me that never has before. I’ve been to plenty of co-ed camps for longer than 9 days so why was this time different. We live about 600 miles away and I was prepared to try and make it work, until we could find a way to be together. He was not ready. He told me the only way for a relationship to work is to have physical connections, which I disagree with. He went on to randomly text me every 3 or so months which was torture. I felt like every time the hurt started to go away, he came back into my life. We would talk for a week or so and he would be gone again. I felt sad and alone then, but it wasn’t until this past summer September that I started to feel lonely. This boy went on to date a new girl, and watching it was painful, I attempted to delete him from my life, and friend zone him those weeks he tried to rekindle us for whatever reason, but he always comes back. On top of the sadness I’ve been struggling with for a years and a half, I’m also applying to college which has ruined my social life. I’ve grown apart from a lot of my friends this year, only adding to the nights by myself. They’ve started to get boyfriends and love interest of sorts and it’s a daily reminder of what I had, and what I lost. It sucks. I’m alone with my work and I know I’m working towards something but sometimes it’s hard to see the end of the tunnel. I don’t know when or if I’ll ever shake that boy out of my head but for the time being I’m attempting to distract myself with work. If you’ve gotten to this point, thank you for reading. I am writing this for myself because writing out my thoughts really helps me progress. I also believe there is somebody else out there with similar struggles and if you are that person just know you’re not alone. I don’t know if I am going up or downhill at this point but I will continue to persevere and hopefully you reading this will too."
"After I realised I never had a chance with this guy. Stupid, typical. So damn Bridget Jones. He was lovely, interesting, kind, generous. We had similar tastes in almost everything, but just enough difference. I’d been feeling things for him for a long time. He didn’t like me that way. Not that he betrayed it verbally. He’s not that kind of guy. I just sort of figured it out. But I knew. I just felt volatile, stupid. So damn stupid. And terribly isolated, let down. I’m not good enough - again. I’ll never find someone. I’ll end up a spinster. You know?"
"Lately my husband has a new single female friend. He constantly texts with her and goes out with her and tells me it‘s just friends. I believe him (for now), but it doesn‘t take away the feeling of jealousy and loneliness when he‘s giving all his attention to this new person, instead of me. I want to be that person who he wants to talk to and spend time with, above all else. I have a lot of wonderful friends, but for my day to day - he‘s it."
In elementary school. I’ve always been a loner and school has never been my strong suit. I tried so hard to fit in and be like everyone else but it’s hard when you have a learning disorder and no one knows about it. I just wanted to fit in.
"One of my best friends had to move out of state to care for her very ill father. The husband of my other best friend was fired by a huge conglomerate a few months short of his retirement. He had worked for this company over 30 years. My best friend was trying to give emotional support to her husband and was worried about her husband and their retirement. My best friend continued working to support both of them.

A few weeks later, my mother fell down her basement stairs and became unconscious at 10AM during a work day. She was taken to the nearby trauma center. My father and brother and sister were told that she would die of the massive bleeding inside her skull. The blood would put pressure on her breathing center of her brain and she would die. It was horrible and shocking and stunning. My husband of 30 years was at work when she fell. I called him & told him my mom had fallen down her basement stairs and was going to die that day, but he stayed at work anyway. She died at 3:45 pm. I called my husband again & he said he’d come to the hospital after he got off of work at 5 pm. It shook me to my core. My best friends were embroiled in their own worries. I felt I had no one to turn to and I felt so alone and lonely.....Then I went to my parents’ home and began calling their friends to tell them the sad news. I was empty."
"I had just moved into a new apartment which I had discovered had a flea infestation. My new job was going terribly. I couldn’t sleep and was trying to hang up curtains and put together a bookshelf at 1 in the morning and I realized I couldn’t do it by myself, but I couldn’t call anyone. I also had no place to sleep besides my bed where fleas were jumping on me. Realizing no one was going to come and help me and knowing I needed help was one of my lowest moments. I just had to wait it out perched on a stool in my kitchen until the sun came up."
"I was with my family on New Year‘s Eve. When the clock hit 12:00, I was the only person in the room that didn‘t get a hug right after the ball dropped. I watched how everyone around me hugged, and I swear to God those were the longest few seconds of my life. I felt so lonely and pathetic, I realized I was nobody‘s person to hug on New Years."
I was a teenager. Sitting alone at lunch realizing I had no friends to sit with me.
"When I was a small child. I was homeschooled and had no friends and a narcissistic mother. I would use my diary as a substitute for friendship, and I would write I love you to my diary because it felt like more of a companion and caregiver than my family did."
I was 25 when I suddenly had the thought that I had shoved people away for far too long. I was still too afraid to change that.
"I felt the most lonely during my birthdays. None of the people that I invite comes to my birthdays ever since I started having parties. I just end up eating every food served on the table and celebrating the ’special’ day with my family. I tried to think positively, but no matter how much they tell me that I should still be happy and feel lucky that I still have my family.. it’s still sad. During my 18th birthday, my dad lost his job (a week before my birthday) 18th birthdays here in the Philippines are supposed to be special and memorable for a girl because it’s her year of coming of age and I got nothing.. Most girls who turn 18 in our country gets gifts, fancy parties and guests.. and I got nothing.

I shouldn’t really be feeling sad over this.. but.. I really did feel sad, even up until a month after my birthday.. And until now that I remember my 18th birthday, it still reminds me of the time when I was crying while praying, not because God gave me another year of life, but because I was so lonely."
"As a grown-up, with wife, and kids, I went to Africa for work. I realized I was unbelievably far from everyone I knew, except my boss, who was literally two doors down in the hall, and with whom I shared nothing."
"I connected with a half-sibling late in life. I believe I made a decent effort to connect over the short years, but for whatever reason, the relationship was never there. I tried to keep this non-relationship going, thinking this is family; I need to keep this going, however much it is not working. I was invited over last Thanksgiving, to be generally ignored or looked upon like I was wasting their time. When I got back home, the I need to keep this going bell went off in my head, so I tried to find out what went wrong and see if things could be remedied. I received a lot of shady, nonsensical reasons for the behaviour, but what was worse was being told they wondered why I had no friends or boyfriend with whom to spend the holidays. I can‘t explain how lonely I felt then. Someone invited me over who didn‘t want me there and made no bones to show it, and then they decided to pull out a catalogue of imaginary people I should have that would somehow make me ... better? more normal? in their eyes. Now I have no contact with that sibling (my choice) and have even less people in my life now than ever."
"Recently my fianceé and I split up. It was a mutual thing because I knew she wasn’t ready for the commitment, but it’s still been hard. We are best friends and we still talk, but right now we’re distancing ourselves from each other for our own good and I just feel so alone. I wake up some nights and reach across the bed thinking she’s there and I wake up holding empty air. I miss her. I miss cuddling up with her and watching Netflix or reading next to each other before bed. I want my friend back but I don’t know what to do."
"Right now. My wife has a chronic illness that causes her daily pain. The loneliest feeling in the world is watching the person you love most in the world shake in pain and not being able to do anything. After the attack passes and she falls asleep, I’m too wired to sleep and cry alone on the couch."
"I get MRIs, imaging that can look at my brain and spinal cord, frequently. I sometimes need them a couple times per year in order to examine the progression that my Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has made. Every time I am in the MRI machine I feel completely alone. I feel vulnerable because behind the glass in the room right next door to mine, images are being flashed on a screen that show how diseased my insides are. I have lesions in my brain and all throughout my spinal cord...yet you wouldn‘t know it unless you saw those scans. My imaging takes at least an hour, sometimes longer. No one can be in the room with me during those tests. I go into the machine alone, tears in my eyes, panic in my heart about what new damage might show up in the results. I am reminded in that machine that I deal with MS alone. No matter what kind of support I have, ultimately I experience the disease by myself."
"I never felt so lonely when I realized that life is harder than I expected as I am getting older. I was so ready to have a family of my own until my ex-BF broke up with me. The sad thing was just after 2 years, I saw their Facebook recently of them getting married. I still don’t know what happened to us – I was so in love with him and I think it was maybe because he held against me the past diagnosis of my doctor that there is maybe a possibility that I may not have a child of my own (even though its not 100% sure). For you to just give up what we had and saying that the reason is there is no more spark is so damn lame. I did everything for him. He should’ve at least let me know earlier so that most of my years was not wasted waiting for him to ask me to marry him. I even professed how much I love to him: so much so that I can take a bullet for him but unfortunately, he did not feel the same way."
"I was a sophomore in college. I met my best friend from one of my freshman classes. We talked about anything and everything from UTIs to breakups to observations of our surroundings, came over to each other’s apartment and took care of the other when sick even though we were boroughs away. But then I got hooked on drugs and I became a completely different person. She tried taking care of me, but at some point I became too much to handle. We sat down and talked about it, and ended our friendship in the most civilized way. It broke my heart. I had never felt so alone. The next day it dawned on me that I no longer had anyone to talk to about petty things like “I’m pretty sure this girl in my finance class just straight up rolled out of bed. She’s in pizza-stained sweatpants.” Just thinking about it makes me tear up. Our friendship breakup changed me forever, for the better. I learned so much from her: I came out a kinder person from the experience. To this day I have not met anyone as great as she was."
"I felt most alone during my second year of law school. I was working full time in Boston at a large firm as a clerk for one of the partners. I commuted an hour home and then another hour to school. I took classes at night. All over social media, I saw my friends living their lives, enjoying their jobs, getting into serious relationships, moving into their own apartments. I felt stunted. While I had coworkers and classmates, I never saw them outside of work or school and rarely had anything in common with them. I have never been able to build a close circle of friends, particularly in the gay community, because I have never felt that I fit their acceptable definition of what a gay man is. It doesn’t help that I am overweight and I’m either viewed as a fetish or a disgusting slob. Feeling like I have no one to turn to who understands me has taken a real toll on not only my mental health but my physical health."
"Christmas 2016. I was already feeling awful after the election of Trump, and I was dreading going home for the holidays knowing most of my family voted for him. But I had already taken time off from work and planned a visit to see my family but mostly my 89 year old mother.

I flew in on Christmas day, fighting the crowds and depressed at not being with my husband back home. When I landed, I was planning to go to a sibling’s house and seeing everyone that day. When I called my sister, she told me they were all busy and had planned to get together a few days later.

I really wish I would have just gone back to the airport and flown back home. Instead, I checked into my hotel but not before having my Christmas dinner: 2 hot dogs from a gas station.

I cried myself to sleep and vowed NEVER to come home for Christmas ever again."
"In the eighth grade, we took a class trip to Washington DC. We got to choose who we wanted to room with, but all three roommates had to write each other down on a form. I had thought I was going to be in a room with my two best friends, but the two of them wrote another girl in for their third and that girl wrote the two of them, leaving me with no one. I didn’t find out about this until the principal of my middle school brought me and one other student on stage in the cafeteria during the entire grade’s lunch period and announced to everyone that neither of us had a room and someone needed to claim us. I had no idea my friends hated me that much, and since that day I remain convinced that everyone hates me that much."
"My boyfriend got a really good job opportunity a couple hours away, and only comes home every other weekend. I’m trying to be supportive, but I hate that he’s not home every night. I’ve been resorting to drinking/drugs to keep myself busy. It’s ruining my life. I can’t tell him."
"I grew up in foster care. Constantly moving, constantly being passed over for adoption. Everyone wanted a baby. No one wanted a 15 year old girl. Than a family wanted me. I lived with them till I was 19. I came out as gay and then they pulled the adoption and kicked me out for being gay. I felt so alone. Like life wasn’t worth living if I had nobody. I started drinking, doing drugs to escape the feeling of being lonely. Even to this day it follows."
"The past few years, I have succeeded in my goal of working in the field of a big organization in international development, something I’ve always dreamt of since I was a teenager. I’ve been fortunate to be able to work in some amazing places that others would normally never see. But it has taken a toll on my personal life. As I age, all my peers find significant others. The men in the missions, who want to have affairs with you, have wives who raise their children and keep their family homes. My country is so expensive, my savings are all I have, but I’m not even halfway able to afford a mortgage alone on my own after 7 years. I don’t even know if I want to live there either. I only have one family member, my mother, after my brother was killed in a car accident when he was 18."
"I grew up in a small abusive family. My family told me things like “don’t get too friendly: at Christmas people will expect Christmas presents.” I think that the goal was to isolate me and my sisters so the abusive behaviors could be hidden. Consequently, I didn’t have the best social skills.

I got older and got tired of being secretive and miserable. To my surprise, when I got a little more open, some people (not all) turned out to be sympathetic. I hadn’t known that I came off as cold: I was trying to be professional.

But I still felt lonely sometimes. I got married to a musician who seemed to be a good match. It was as if our motto was “you and me against the world.”

Part of that “you and me against the world” turned out to be a kind of grooming by my husband. There was this great enveloping narrative that he was this great musician, he had never gotten what he deserved career-wise, his ex-wife was a conniving &*&, and with my help he was going to “make it.”
That should have been my clue right there. We got along—as long as I kept in mind that my life’s work is supposed to be “figuring out how to make HIM successful”. One day I woke up and realized that I could not fix this person. Starting in the morning, along with a cup of coffee, I get a full dose of his negativity—this person won’t “give him a job,” and that person won’t acknowledge what a great musician he is. And that I am selfish for not dropping my exhausting work schedule to stop and work on music with him. (Because that makes sense—stop my paid work to work on music that hasn’t paid much in the many many years we have been together.)

Amy Tan (the author) recently spoke on Fresh Air (a radio program) about her mother (who she describes as possibly borderline). She pointed out her mother was only happy when they were both complaining about the ills of the world (real or imagined). Similarly, I am only on my husband’s good side when I agree with him about all the wrongs he feels he faces. He rarely sees positives; he lives in a world of perpetual grievance.

I work from home now. He is home all the time. He spends all day trying to get me to agree with his narrative of the world. It’s exhausting, it’s stifling, and I feel I can never have my own head space. And it’s lonely."
"I‘m on winter break from college right now, and in the last couple days my parents have been questioning me about my relationship with my boyfriend and insisting that I don‘t care about their feelings. Some of their old ideas make me feel very uncomfortable, and I‘m finding communication with them extremely difficult because they get fixed on negative ideas about me. Also I think they read my journal secretly, and this makes me furious. Problems with my parents make me feel very lonely, and the reverse culture shock Ive felt ever since I came back to China is making it worse. The only person I can really talk to is my boyfriend, but hes physically so far away."
"A year ago, my girlfriend who was the only person I was 100% honest with left me for another guy. We were living together so my place got a lot quieter. Everyone around me tells me to move on. I’m trying but it’s really hard to meet new people. I am a healthcare professional and an instructor and I help people overcome their mental health obstacles. The new people I meet are in need of my help or students. I cannot date these people ethically. It’s ironic that I help others overcome their loneliness and obstacles but I cannot help myself. To add to the problem, I am shy and a rare personality type: INFJ. As a male INFJ, some say I make up less than 1% of the population. There is loneliness in not having people understand me as a person. I have so much to give but I just keep it all to myself and focus on my job. I’m very good at it as I am one of the youngest instructors hired by my post-secondary institution. I just wish that my job was not the only thing I have. At my job, I’m constantly working with people but I’ll never be able to form anything more than a therapeutic relationship with them. It’s like being in loneliness hell sometimes."
"I was dating someone who was emotionally abusive to me. I had been trying to fix things between us and sent him a text that angered him instead. He responded to it by calling me an idiot and telling me to fuck off. I received those texts when I was grocery shopping. I distinctly remember standing in front of the tomatoes reading these harsh, cruel words and feeling so hurt and alone that I just started to cry. It wasn’t the actions of the man I cared about that made me lonely but it was the fact that I could stand in a busy grocery store and openly cry and not have one single person ask me if I was okay."
"The seclusion of ourselves. We all intensify our loneliness with technology. Everyone has some type of loneliness is their life including myself. But we all intensify that feeling when we go on our phones instead of talking to each other or worrying about how many likes or comments you get on a picture instead of connecting to the people who are with you. I’m not blaming people in general and I know this isn’t everyone’s case, but the majority of us nowadays intensify our own loneliness instead of appreciating what’s in front of us. Never forget to look up once in a while and talk to someone instead of worrying about who’s looking at your social media."
"Fifty Novembers ago, I was roused to consciousness in the emergency ward at The Toronto Western Hospital by nurses and young doctors asking me questions that I had no patience for responding, my head was exploding with dangerous pain! Eventually I was placed in an observation ward while specialists determined how best to treat my injury, I was completely paralyzed on the left side of my body, even my face was affected. During the many months that I was hospitalized, family and friends even strangers would visit and chat with me but facing an uncertain future, I understood that my old life was gone forever and I needed to discover new roads. I felt alone and abandoned by life! My head injury was painful and I suffered ridiculous nightmares when I would hallucinate screaming crazily, waking my wardmates. Many patients admitted to observation wards in the 1960s were waiting for the end of their stay on the planet, I witnessed more than a few gentlemen that I chatted with closing their eyes forever. On one occasion a head nurse asked if the deaths bothered me, I do not recall answering. I was crying, perhaps for myself! Life doesn’t end when we lose the thrill and joy of doing things we love, but the process to heal and rejoin the community is a slow tedious process. I am no longer alone or feel lonely but somehow it took 20 years for people to feel comfortable around me again. Or perhaps it took that same period for me to be comfortable with myself again."
"I think that I am currently experiencing the loneliest point in my life. After being out of school for three years I decided to go back to school for my masters. I got into a great school in the UK with two scholarships that covered almost all of my tuition, so I decided to go. I left my friends, family, pets, and my live-in boyfriend of four years. I went from talking about getting engaged and buying a house to living alone in a dorm on the other side of the world. This is the first time I’ve ever lived alone, and I am doing it in a country that isn’t my own. Living abroad seems so glamorous, but it has been the loneliest and hardest thing I’ve ever done. I always will stand out because of my accent, and I will never truly fit in here no matter how much I want to."
"Being a homosexual in the south, especially now, never has been easy and it never does get truly better. Four months ago my job I had worked at for two years let me go, the reason they gave me was because I was making the male employees uneasy...I was in a pool of seven women. I didn’t understand but I cleaned out my desk and left. Then my work friends became my friends, then my acquaintances, then poof – they were gone. Fast forward 4 months later, the coffee shop is a fine job while I’m trying to get a business loan going to open my own business, but it’s not full time and the days I’m home and my partner is out working his “big boy” job, everyone’s gone. Everyone. If it wasn’t for the cat this big empty house would literally be my prison. But I will make it through. We all will."
"When I put my puppy to sleep, me & My bestfriend are in a fight"
"Before I found recovery from my eating disorder, I was living in someone‘s basement, away from home for the first time. I was 19. My eating disorder was spiralling out of control – I couldn‘t stop eating and had just started making myself throw up. I had tried seeing a psychologist for help, but felt spoken down to and did not want to see her again. I didn‘t know where else to turn for help.

I couldn‘t understand why I couldn‘t stop eating, it was torture. I didn‘t want to be eating – my jaws hurt, I was gaining weight so quickly I had stretch marks, I was eating food out of the garbage and stealing from my roommates. And yet I presented the image of perfection to all of my coworkers. I was thin, athletic, outgoing...no one would have guessed what I was doing behind closed doors.

One night, I felt so alone and was so desperate to stop eating, I took scissors out of the drawer and tried to cut myself – I thought if someone saw scars on my forearms, someone would notice that I needed help.

Luckily, I stopped before the scissors pierced my skin, and soon after, I found help with twelve-step recovery groups for compulsive eating/bulimia/anorexia. It saved my life, and those groups continue to save my life each day."
"My fiancé left me a few years ago on Valentine’s Day, after finding out I had cancer. Even through I’m handsome and kind and know a ton of people, I have no friends and spent Christmas Day for the third year in a row alone in my studio apartment. I thought things would get better, but they don’t in spite of my trying. I go to the grocery store a lot now just so I can talk to another person. My family are Mormon and ostracized me twenty years ago, and I’ve never found a replacement family. I love the stories here, it made me feel loved simply by knowing there are others like me."
"There have been many. Most often I‘ve been surrounded by people, and yet felt completely and utterly alone. Some of the loneliest times of my life were on tour with my band.

For three years I was the bass player in a moderately successful pop punk band. We traveled the country, and later the world, and though I was surrounded by people all the time (band mates, other bands, people‘s houses we stayed at, fans / audience) I felt completely alone.

The other members of the band were very politically minded, socially conscious folks who thought very highly of themselves in terms of awareness, acceptance, and compassion not to mention thinking themselves champions of the underdog and the oppressed. Despite all of their rhetoric when it came down to it they simply could not, or would not, accept me and the communication / attention / emotional issues that being on the spectrum present. They were awful to me.

I was separated from my dog, one of the only beings I‘ve ever felt truly connected to, my friends, and my work (routine keeps me grounded and functioning). Eventually I left that band, but the experience has stayed with me all these years later. I have a hard time trusting people who say they are my friends that they‘re not going to talk behind my back, or lash out at me when I do something neuro-atypical. It’s very hard for me to get close to people and this experience made that much harder still. There were good things about that time in my life; I felt like I had friends, I felt like I belonged, I felt like I had a giant nationwide community, and there were fun times. I worry that I‘ll never feel any of those things again, even though feeling them the first time almost ruined me.

After that experience I fell into a deep depression that eventually led to me becoming a heroin addict for the next six years on and off, until the final two years were just on and I almost died. I‘m clean now, but I know how slippery that slope is and how easy it is to fall down. I feel lonely about that too, I miss heroin sometimes and the ease and comfort it gave me that nothing else in my life ever has."
"So many times; there is no most lonely. If there were, I guess the most lonely would be anytime that I focus on that feeling. Immediately, the floor goes out from under me and I am in free fall; no one to catch me; no one to acknowledge my existence. I am even alone when at family gatherings. They have their familiar conversations; I don‘t fit in, so I sit quietly and don‘t even listen. None of them talk about topics that interest me. Odd man out; always the odd man out. That‘s me."
"I go to a pretty conservative Christian school – and as a Asian lesbian, it‘s really hard to get through the day, listening to the homophobic and racist comments I hear all the time. The friends I make at school all have turned out to be horrible in some form; either letting people bully minorities and laughing at it, or doing something absolutely horrible to someone else. I realised that I‘ve been bullied since Year 7 for being different, even though Ive been convinced that I was only overreacting.

The only true friends are the ones Ive made through the internet... but they have their own lives, and I cant ask them to dedicate every second of the day to me, especially living in different time zones. Whenever Im alone, after they all go to sleep... it really hits me, how lonely I really am. Its hard to get through the day when the school tries to cut me off from them, and my parents dont know about them, because Im scared theyll try to cut me off as well."
I was at a party in college. I only knew one person and felt like I was following her around like a lost puppy. I am terrible at starting conversations and left very shortly after arriving. I went home by myself and cried for the good time I could have had.
"The time I felt the most lonely was when I decided to have an abortion. I was in an abusive relationship and knew that having a baby in that environment would be detrimental. My family talked me into having the abortion, but I was so conflicted as all I’d ever wanted in life was to be a mother. Here I was with the opportunity, and was giving it up. I felt like no one understood what I was experiencing, and because abortion is such a polarizing subject, I didn’t feel safe opening up to people about it. I had to go through the day with extreme emotional anguish and pretend I felt okay. Even though this took place years ago, there are still days where I feel alone when I think about it because I don’t think anyone will be able to relate to me."
I was standing on the golden gate bridge. There were seals playing in the surf. The wind was blowing. And humanity just kept walking by.
"I was the short fat kid that was the last to be picked for dodgeball... You want to laugh, I‘m still short and but now add bald to that list. Oh, it‘s been loads of fun. Anyway, I remember it was cold in November but there was no snow in the ground yet. I don‘t know why but I‘d gone around the where the teachers parked their cars. Students werent allowed there. I sat there between two cars and started crying. I remember wishing I could go somewhere else. Be in a place where people were kind. Still feel that way."
"I’ve felt lonely from birth, like something was always missing. I have always been shy too. I don’t relate well with people my age. Never have. The teens were the worst. It was a struggle to fit in and I didn’t want to. As an adult I feel other again where I live. No one is like me, acts like me, thinks as I do. It’s a weird feeling and a nagging struggle."
"At a party. We were arriving late because she consistently runs late. At first I thought I could help her be on time, then it became apparent to me that this is purposeful. Running late always set a tense mood. We came in frustrated, irritable. Then put on a happy face. I spent the night on the other side of the room trying to smile. It was that night I simply realized we don‘t like each other. For me this is loneliness."
"I used to volunteer at a camp every summer, and I used to love it. This past summer, for the first time in 6 or 7 years, I felt the isolating effects of my deteriorating hearing loss and speech capabilities. I made ZERO new friends that week and if anything, lost touch with old friends. This was a camp I had always felt safe at due to the inherent inclusive nature of everyone involved, but this year was different. I felt so cast aside by the very people I thought I could trust to not do that, I ended up keeping to myself and counting down the days until the week was over. All I wanted to do was sit alone in my home because I thought that would spare everyone else from having to listen to me talk. There is no sense of isolation like feeling unable to communicate with those around you."
"I went to a conference several states away from home a few years ago, to schmooze with some folks from a school where I wanted to apply to be a graduate student. There was a big social gathering the first night of the conference, and the people I was trying to schmooze with didn‘t arrive until about an hour and a half after it started. In a room with a couple hundred people, I was more desolately alone than I‘ve felt since I was about twelve years old. The conference was a week long, and even though I had people to tag along with much of the time, after finally finding them, I felt like a third, fifth, seventh wheel, and every night I went back to my room and cried."
"The loneliest I feel is when I am at work as a resident physician in a large Canadian hospital. I stay awake for 26 to 28 hours overnight caring for my patients who believe doctors cannot do their jobs because of what they hear on TV and being berated and abused by my supervisors and the nurses. This is common amongst all medical teaching institutions in the country. I and many of my peers are overwhelmed; several have problems with addictions, and many express thoughts of suicide. One of my loneliest moments was when somebody asked me why I kept talking to them about how strenuous work was. I realised that while we all dealt with deep depression, the ones who were doing well had loved ones who cared to talk to about their feelings. The rest of us are dying in a system that uses brute force and abuse to teach us how to save a life, but we will never be able to talk about it openly for fear that we will lose our jobs and then subsequently our lives, because it is all we have now."
"Saturday evening I took my children to a parade downtown. I had been consumed by my children and other family for a good part of the day so I hadn‘t had time to even stop and think. As I am standing on the parade route watching the floats pass by, the loneliness hit. I was surrounded by literally thousands of people including three that I love most in the world but I had to hold back tears. In that moment, while the kids were still and the hustle and bustle of the day had settled, I realized that the lingering feeling, the ache in my chest was there. It was as if the parade had slowed down to a crawl and all of the voices around me had hit the slow motion button.

I was present but I wasn‘t.

I was thinking about the life I left with my children‘s father and about the unknown life in front of me. I never realized how lonely raising children would be.

In that moment I looked around at couples and ached for what they had. I want someone to be by my side and love me. The reality that I live in wonders if I will ever find someone who will want to be part of my crazy life. Want to grow a relationship with someone who has so much on their plate."
Never
I went to the theater alone to see a movie. On the screen a man was sitting in a restaurant alone looking sad. From behind me a man says pathetic. I thought to myself: the guy in the movie is me. Am I pathetic?
"At the beginning of high school I had friends and by the end I had none. The people I thought were my friends did not turn out to be my friends and I spent most of my days being verbally abused by some of them. I felt really powerless and I pretended to not care but it really got the best of me. At home there were things going on with my family and since the ones I thought I could open up to betrayed me I became more and more enclosed. I still find it really hard to share anything with anyone, I am really afraid."
I was sitting at the dinner table eating by myself after making Sunday dinner. No one came when I called. I ate by myself.
"Six months ago a colleague of mine became my manager. In essence, he refused to provide feedback or oversight for any of my projects and began a campaign of undermining my reputation at work. As our office had thin walls, I could hear much of his conversations with colleagues that would basically consist of him convincing people who I thought were friends and confidants that I was incompetent and responsible for what were ostensibly his shortcomings.

It hurt so badly to watch these relationships crumble... but more than anything it was the most lonely moment in my life because in that time I realized that one well-situated person can sully the waters of thousands of hours of authenticity. In the end, I left that job. It has been hard trying keep in touch with people who refuse to keep plans or see you. I still wonder what exactly I did or said.. As an adult, I cannot reconcile how painful it is to watch people you love, trust, and respect be so fickle and so disingenuous. I still struggle daily with the loss of so many friends in such a short time."
"The loneliest I felt was when my roommate moved out of our apartment in the middle of the semester. At first I loved the solitude of it all, relishing the newfound freedoms I had been granted (goodbye pants!) Eventually, I started to miss the feeling of being noticed and acknowledged by others every day. Eventually, it started to feel like the world was beginning to forget I was there."
"When I was in primary school, nobody wanted to be friends with me, because I am autistic and struggled with holding conversation. Everyone thought I was weird and made fun of me. Kids overestimate their ability to whisper."
"Once I had a rough day at work. I was supposed to hang out with friends after and was really looking forward to it. When I got there, they told me that I was too upset to be around them and kicked me out of their apartment. All I wanted was some support."
"At the age of 36, I finally realized that I was depressed and probably been for a very long time. I fell apart emotionally, sought out treatment, and after several years I was feeling better about myself (this gave me the courage to get out of an abusive marriage along with my three children). When I was in hospital for my depression my mother visited and asked me “how could you do this to me?”

None of my siblings visited, I had no close friends so no friends visited either. I was ashamed and felt lesser than... I’m sounding melodramatic, the truth is I always feel lonely. ALWAYS. My life has a great deal of wonderful moments. I remarried a lovely, kind man, I have grandchildren. I have a comfortable lifestyle. Yet, I feel utterly alone."
"When I won my first Judo Tournament at 28, I told my friends about my 1st place victory that evening at a restaurant we all met up that evening. Everyone stared at me like I didn’t belong at that table. I was surrounded by people and I just felt so alone and defeated. I didn’t feel welcomed the whole time and just picked at the food we ordered. I began to not wanting to do Judo, a sport I loved dearly, after that event because I felt alone for liking things that none of my coworkers, friends, and family had in common. Being a individual and yourself was casting a aura around me which people wanted to avoid. I felt that this loneliness was of my own making and I needed to like things that others liked so I can be included and not so lonely. I wanted to be normal. Being normal and trying to fit in with my friends only made me feel more lonely. Allowing myself to accept my differences is what allows me to be at peace with this feeling. Fitting in with the popular crowd is just not something I wanted to do but the conventions of modern society wants me to do. It’s not normal for someone to not go on a coffee date with friends because you want to train for 2 hours on Judo moves they been thinking about for a week with people who understand. It’s not normal to avoid parties because you have a date with a couch and a book you want to finish up. When my loneliness hits me, it is just a reminder that I am just doing what I can in a society that doesn’t agree with everything that I do. It’s made everything I do worthwhile and reminds me that while not everyone will agree with my life, I always have someone who gets my choices and I do the same for them."
I was the only person in my 9th grade health class who believed in abstinence. Everyone thought I was a freak. I was completely isolated from everyone and no one wanted to talk to me. I never had a partner in gym class and I’d always do my work alone. It hurt like hell. I was made to feel worthless only because I wanted to save myself.
"There’s never been one time where I’ve felt the most lonely. It’s rather a constant thing that I feel everyday. I have friends and family I can count on for support but no one with whom I can connect or share anything. I’ve been a journalist for about 3 years now and have covered mostly crime and war. I’ve seen enough death, bloodshed and devastation to last a lifetime, and I don’t really know anyone with whom I can relate to anymore. Veterans have a lot of support groups, mental health access and so on. But journalists make little money and have no support. The images of bloodied corpses, of people screaming and terrified for their life, of children staring at dead bodies, of soldiers with shrapnel in their chest bleeding profusely, of trying to sleep when bombs are dropping around me, are constantly with me no matter how hard I try to forget. The only time I can connect with people are when I’m in these arenas, but it’s always fleeting and then they’re out of my life and all I’m left with is more trauma."
"A while ago, in the early summer, I had fallen incredibly in love with someone despite the fact that neither of us were quite ready for a relationship. When we returned to school in the fall I was faced with the prospects that they were an incredibly outgoing and loving person, something which scared and overwhelmed me (as a quiet and very shy person). When I went to them to tell them about my fears, it scared them. It scared them that I am someone with mental health issues and am someone that doesn’t like themselves are as a person. To this point, this person had only seen me in 1-on-1 situations where I am much more carefree and fun. Though I can only guess their thoughts, I imagine the prospects of having to deal with me as a burden was too much for them and they told me that we couldn’t continue to be together.
I spent 2 days at home, periodically sitting in the bottom of the shower or lying on the floor, debating suicide. To be told that your mental health is a burden to others is not easy to hear. On the 3rd day, out of nothing more than obligation, I went to work. There I had a heart-to-heart with a coworker I had never really connected with. She managed to rally the other employees to give me a longer break and bought me ice cream and took me out for beer after work. I understand that not everyone is lucky enough to find someone to pull them out of the bottom when they need it the most. But I remain eternally grateful."
"Being admirably independent is a curse. It translates that people just naturally assume that you’ll be okay on your own. While there is truth within that notion, they forget that when we ask for help, it’s truly a moment that we need help. I asked for assistance to move and each person dismissed me you’ll be fine on your own, I’m sure you can handle it yourself, you’re so organized, you don’t need extra help. On the day I moved into my new townhouse, I bawled on my doorstep. I felt so alone and abandoned.
Being admirably independent also means feeling achingly alone."
"I was a new mom and my daughter’s witching hour was at 3 AM. This time of day was the most lonely for me and the first time I truly felt the depth of how lonely parenthood would end up being for me. I would stand in front of the window looking out over the neighbourhood (while feeding the babe) and I would think about how everyone was sleeping (including my significant other) and I felt like I was the only one awake feeling my wretched feelings. To keep me company, I would keep the TV in the bedroom on. I would watched Real Housewives and Paradise Hotel re-runs. To this day turning the TV on helps me feel less lonely and reduces my anxiety – it has become a source of comfort for me.

I have resented my daughter and being a parent – before this I never felt this degree of isolation. I suffered from postpartum depression for nearly 8 years after she was born and that is an isolating experience because after a while people don’t want to help you deal with it anymore – they become tired and push you away. Thankfully, I am feeling less depressed. As she grows older and becomes someone that I can relate with parenting becomes less of a chore. I think all of my feelings stem from the fact that I never wanted children and now I am stuck with the duty of being responsible for another human life – and my loneliness is borne out of being dislocated from what I truly wanted for myself. I love my daughter and she is a beautiful and amazing soul and I do my best to be the best that I can be, but it’s not enough, for me."
"My first two months in my current city. I had just moved here and didn’t know a single soul. I had a tiny basement apartment where I lived alone, and everyone I loved (including my wonderful boyfriend) was a 3 hour flight away."
"Sitting on the playground sometime before I was ten. I would read under the trees, or just stare out and watch the other kids playing. I didn’t understand them, their unadulterated joy just from from screaming and running. I was such a serious child, I thought that I was above that. I was taught that being silly and childlike was a thing to be ashamed of, that being quiet and smart was valued more in a person. I had a vivid imagination, one that went wild into fantasy or my potential future life. But that didn’t extend past dreaming and writing stories. I was too afraid of being embarrassed by the other children, being made fun of or singled out for something I did. I still can’t get over that feeling to this day, that I’m constantly being evaluated and judged. It makes for a lonely world – you have to be able to stomach vulnerability to conquer loneliness."
Opening up my heart to another man two years after my divorce only to be rejected and betrayed again. I cried everyday for about a year. I thought I‘d never recover. My husband was the only man I‘d ever been with so this was risky business for me. It took all the courage within me to even meet this man for coffee. I look back now and see him for what he is but that experience has crippled me. I will never trust or risk my heart again. It would take Superman cape and all to get me to risk my heart. I‘m doomed to grow old and die alone. All this stupid technology that “connects” us and yet look at the loneliness.
"I was 5 years old when I moved with my Mom from Nakhon Sawan, Thailand to Berlin. Before that I normally lived with my auntie and my grandmother. We sleep and eat together everyday and by night I used to sleep with my grandmother. So I was never alone somehow. My family is complicated. My Mom couldn‘t look after me because she has to work so I never saw her. And when we move to Berlin everything changed. Well, my Mom was a really strict and impatient person. It was hard to lived with her. I had no friends, couldn‘t speak german and I couldn‘t understand why I have to sleep alone. This was the time when I feel really lonely in a big city."
"The loneliest I felt was when I heard that I needed an emergency surgery, and I had no one to accompany me to the hospital. I went through that phase with the help of spiritual company, and I’m forever grateful to the imaginary friend we can all call upon at times."
"A few years ago, I went up to my cottage with my sister and a couple of her friends. On Sunday they left to head home ahead of my sister and I, so we went for a quick fishing trip in the morning, with plans to drive home that afternoon. On the trip, she started asking me probing questions about my my mental and physical health. We weren’t really on that level of sharing, and I was in counselling already to help define boundaries between me and my family as their impact on me was continuously negative. This incident proved, again, to be exactly that. I tried to answer her questions with a certain restriction, as I wasn’t game to share too much - she previously hadn’t treated my experience and feelings with a level of respect that I appreciated. This seemed to antagonize her, and she pressed really hard for info. Then asking why we can’t get along. Why are we not better sisters? I had to let her know I didn’t trust her with my stuff. That I’ve been through a trauma in my childhood, that she doesn’t accept or understand, and I still deal with PTSD-like symptoms to this day that she doesn’t acknowledge. She asked if I had been diagnosed, and pressed to see if my counselling was appropriate to deal with my issues. I felt very judged and triggered by her questions, she again didn’t show the concern for me that I felt a sister should show. It was clinical and cold. It seemed to come from the doubt she had about my experience. So I called her out on that, and got angry, eventually lashing out.

My reaction was exaggerated and extreme. It came from a deeply hurt place in me, that perpetually feels the divide between me and my family and longs for more care and consideration from them. She lashed back, and it just didn’t de-escalate. Over 4 hours we fought as we packed up the cottage. Eventually I paid $40 for a cab to take me to the bus station in town. Then $70 for a bus ticket home, leaving her at the cottage to drive home solo. I fended off my dad in a follow-up call, where he accused me of being the problem, again.

I sat on a pre-made floating dock from a store near the bus stop, crying as I defended myself, and all the information I shared with my sister. I answered the phone thinking he might be concerned for me. Maybe he was, but it’s not what came through. This was the most decisive move I’ve made against my family, in support of myself. It’s also the first time I very physically felt the divide. It is a deep wound, to be emotionally estranged from your family out of self-preservation. Like every time I am feeling alone and need support, and think maybe I’ll call home. I have to point to the wound and remind myself of the hurt. Cause if I don’t they’ll do it again, and I’m the one who suffers. So alone is an everyday feeling. I felt it the most that day, but the wound is always with me."
"I went to a party with my ex best-friend, who had not talked to me in weeks because she was too consumed with her boyfriend. She didn’t even talk to me, put in effort or try to be there for me."
"My parents left the US to go back to Turkey in 2013. I was in my senior year of university and I had just moved in with my friend and her family. There were about 8-10 of us there each day but I felt more alone than ever. I did not know who I was without the guidance of my parents. I was raised in a Muslim household where you go from your father’s house to the house of your spouse...except I was not married and did not plan to marry anytime soon, nor did I have any real prospects. I gained weight, stopped taking care of myself, cried myself to sleep nearly every night, and lost my friend/roommate due to my insecurities. It took me a long time to figure out my own path, but I have and I am not defined by anyone else but me today. I do not fear being alone anymore because I am all that I will ever need. When I shifted my perspective the universe brought in more people into my life, people who genuinely care and I am forever thankful. I would not be the person I am right now if it was not for the excruciating lonely phase I experienced from 2013-2015. I still remember that girl and I honor her struggle by sitting in empty parking lots for a few hours at a time (a favorite past-time of mine when I had no friends or family) here and there."
"TELL ME THE STORY OF THE TIME YOU FELT THE MOST LONELY.
Being an entrepreneur is really tough and very lonely. The buck stops with you and you have to be on top of everything all the time. In the early years there is no revenue so you have to get by on very little. And the hardest part is when times are tough, you doubt whether what you are doing is going to work, but you can‘t tell anyone how you really feel. In tech startups, founders are 90% men who bluff their way along and never admit that everything isnt great. No one ever says things suck. I understand a little why a friend committed suicide. There was no one he could share what was really going on in his life. Im at a point with my business where Im running out of energy and cant get motivated to work 24/7. Id like to share my real challenges with someone but there is no one. This makes it very lonely."
I felt most lonely when I was out having drinks with my friends and they started talking about their relationships and sex lives. I couldn’t relate because I have always been single and never had sex. I started to wonder if I’m missing out by not dating or ’putting myself out there’. I also think what if I never find a partner and remain forever alone. I never think about it too much until I’m reminded by similar conversations.
"My parents fight a lot. Belonging to a culture where divorce is heavily frowned upon, all I hear some days are loud yelling, crying, and weeks after that: stony silence. It wrecks me. My sister, half my age, I try to shield her from them. Close the door. Put music on.

I know they love me. I know they don’t love each other.

Days like this I feel lonely. I count down the days until I can leave, count down the days until my sister is left alone with people that hate each other, but love her. They don’t care.

I feel lonely a lot."
"To understand my story, it’s important to understand its origin. My wife passed when I was 31 years old. Leaving me with a 4 and 2 year old. Raising them became my sole purpose in life. Now they are both away in college I struggle to find and understand my purpose in life. I listen to couples espouse the joys of empty nesting but for me it’s just a dark hole of nothingness every day after work. I work 11 hours a day simply because I have nothing better to do. There’s got to be a better way."
"The most lonely I’ve felt is when I found out about my anxiety, and it just made me feel crazy, and every time someone looks at me, I tell myself that they think I’m crazy too."
"This year I’ve felt both very lonely and very connected. I started university, which began with me pretending I didn’t mind sitting alone when I ate lunch and ended with a best friend and a bunch of other wonderful people who genuinely care about my wellbeing. I still feel lonely when I realise I can’t tell them how much I worry about my mother and her recent alcoholism, though. Sometimes I get home and she’ll be drunk and I’ll feel so guilty for leaving her alone. I keep finding bottles and glasses of vodka stashed away and I get so paranoid that I’m disrespecting her boundaries in trying to find the alcohol she’s hiding from me. The other day she stole alcohol that was a present for my friend and lied about it. She’s not a bad person and she’s been a wonderful mother to me. I think this makes it harder; I’ve trusted her completely my whole life and now whenever I see her I feel nothing but paranoia and isolation. I’m the loneliest I’ve ever been."
"Last week. I got broken up with by someone I had opened up to and talked about a future with, and after the break up I went into a depressed spiral of not eating and not talking to people and just wallowing. Realising that people’s lives just go on while yours is crumbling, and that people can just not notice, is something terribly isolating. But once I extended my hand and said I need help please, I realised how many people care, they just can’t read minds."
"December 17th 2017, my girlfriend went to the United States to help her father, who was going through a medical treatment. After the flight, she spent days without contacting me. It was only when I tried to reach her, I found out she had cancelled her emails and changed her phone number. To this day, I still check my phone and emails every hour, waiting for an answer."
"I feel most lonely RIGHT NOW realizing that my adult daughters don’t care what I do or where I go (my grandchildren are getting bigger and do not need me like they used to) and my husband is mentally talking himself into being old at 74, and I now have to face the truth that he never cared about me and does not have the ability to love me or listen to my needs. My son died at 30 and the pain will never go away (after 9 years) so that is sitting inside my stomach and my family will not discuss it with me (a mother who is crying for her child). I am trying to understand what I did wrong in my life (and my children’s lives) that they are so callous as not to even listen to their mother’s cry for help. I guess I never showed them my vulnerability before so this situation is not something they know how to deal with. I was always there for them and still am. They are treating me now like a schmatta or rag that they can now either throw away or do not need any more (unless a crisis arises). I don’t really have good close friends who might care and acquaintances don’t really give a damn. I don’t seem to have interests that I can pursue and I feel much younger than my age and I haven’t met too many women my age that don’t talk about their ailments or operations. I am a younger person at heart that feels comfortable talking to mothers who have younger children but I am still 73 years old. Our finances are limited so I cannot pursue my only passion right now of fixing up my house so that I can feel refreshed and, of course, my husband doesn’t care where he lives. All he cares about is that I feed him and not give him stress. I don’t need anti-depressants (which would make my physical being a basket case) I JUST NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO, BE COMPASSIONATE TOWARDS ME AND NOT JUDGE ME FOR FEELING THIS WAY. I have given up on my psychologist because after a while, they don’t want to hear everyday whining, they eventually want to see results. I guess I should look for another psychologist but that’s just the way my life is going. Loneliness is eating me up alive."
"When I got to Canada and left my abusive parents’ home. Had no friends, not even casual ones, barely making rent and my friends back home with the time difference couldn’t match up. Felt like I was sinking everyday without anyone to call out for."
"Some nights when my depression gets bad, I badly need someone to talk to, and the first time I had a full on wave of depression was the first time I realized I had no one to talk to about it. No one I knew was I comfortable to share it with, and my parents were definitely out of the picture. I was forced to internalize it, and the next day when I went to school I expected people to notice that I was not alright, and that I needed someone to talk to and didn’t know who to reach out to. No one noticed. I realized then that it didn’t matter how I felt on the inside and how well I knew myself if everyone I know sees me as a bright and happy girl. If I’m the only person that actually knows who I am, how does anyone really know me at all? Are we really the people we know ourselves to be if everyone else has a different image of us? Do I exist outside of their main image of me?"
"When two of my dearest friends got married and I was in the wedding party. My SO couldn’t be there and I didn’t know many of the other people attending. I love to dance, loved the music... but no one was dancing with me, no matter how much I tried to dance and just let go. So I left the wedding tent and stood outside in a field under the stars, hearing the far away music and dancing by myself because that was the only place I could dance."
When I found out that my partner of 20+ years had cheated on me with multiple women over the years while coming home to me every day pretending that all was well. Incredible sadness and loneliness that lingers even though we are now separated.
"The time I felt the loneliest… I actually never knew at the moment I was lonely. It actually was a progression of many years. In my younger years I never felt lonely as I was always in a social setting. Dinners, parties, nightclubs and college life seemed to fill the void of companionship. About 5 years ago I stopped drinking and had my first of 3 children. As the bar days were over and I was spending more time at home with my family. Things seemed good and stable.

It was around this time that the dynamics in my household started to change. I love my partner to death but as we started to argue more often I realized that she was my only confidant. She was there for when I had work issues, when I was mad at the other drivers on the road or if I just wanted to share a good story about my day. With kids screaming and enough problems of her own, these conversation were becoming further and further apart. I had so much to share, but no one to share with. Scrolling through my phone looking for someone to reach out to, I found no shortage of business associates, old college buddies, some far of relatives but no one that I could share my most inner feelings with. This was when I felt the hurt in my chest knowing that this time I really was alone. I had a bomb of emotions inside me and I needed to diffuse it. I went for a walk, allowed myself to hurt and began to reassure myself that albeit I felt alone in that moment, that out there was another man walking on a path, feeling my same emotions.

Loneliness definitely hurts. I have tried to take my experiences and use them to learn about myself and experience how the human soul can persevere. I do long for a meaningful relationship but at the same time I am using this opportunity to develop my own strength and self-awareness so that one day I can be a good friend to the other man walking life’s journey in parallel with me… alone…. for now."
"I was, still am I guess, a foster kid. The feeling of abandonment never leaves you, it just continues to grow. My ’family’ was there, but I never belonged. I just drifted in and out of the family experience, feeling like I could disappear any moment and it would be easier for everyone. To this day I still talk to them, and I know they care, but the feeling still follows. I moved and I was even more alone, I would break down every couple of months. Now loneliness is a way of life, and it’s harder than ever to let people in."
"This may sound like a stand-up routine or a sitcom, but it’s me. Folding sheets. Seriously. When I lived with someone, it was a fun routine, a ritual, a practiced task. Even the cats got involved trying to get into the sheets that were half-way folded, that looked like a hammock to them. Now, living alone, folding sheets is a nightmare. There is no way to be successful. Even if I fold them on the floor, they just get dirty again. And those goddamn fitted sheets! UGH! And then after I’ve stuffed them away in the closet, then pull them out to make my bed with fresh sheets, they resemble used kleenex! So insult to injury, I go to bed at night alone sleeping in these ridiculously creased sheets. Sigh."
"I’m Indian, so one day at lunch I had my food, this was in 6th grade. Another 6th grader started yelling at me why you eatin’ dat shiiiiit that shiiiiits ugly as an obvious attempt to look cool. If I had a friend with me I could have stood up to him, but I was alone and he was with his friends so I just moved tables."
"I don’t think there was ever one specific time I felt most lonely. I turned 34 a couple of months ago and it sort of hit me that I am still alone in my mid-thirties. I live in a rural area and there aren’t many prospects so it looks like my being alone isn’t going to change anytime soon. Loneliness is starting to be more apparent to me, and starting to feel more permanent and that really scares me."
"I have no friends and I’m not close enough with anyone to even message occasionally so when I get bored I go on walks. These walks lead to me thinking about life and then my mood goes down. Once when I was walking I was thinking about being asexual and aromantic and how I’d never get married or move in with someone I love... Then I got thinking about how I’ll have to move in with a friend and rely a lot on friendships. I realized that I’ll never have a boyfriend and I’m honestly terrified of making friends so my future will be filled with being alone in my apartment, not talking to anyone outside of work for months at a time and utter boredom. I wish I had a group of friends, I wish I had a best friend and most of all I wish I wasn’t aromantic/asexual because I hate being alone. I’m going to be alone for the rest of my life..."
"My wife passed away a little over a year ago. There are many days that I feel this overwhelming sadness but the worst is when I turn to share something with her and I realize that I can’t.

I know it will get better but I sure don’t feel like it has. Work helps to fill some of the void but when I am tired or just tired of work, it gets hard to keep going. I am probably depressed but I am still functional, just not happy.

It’s been said many times that people just want to be loved and I do believe that is true. I was and now I don’t feel it as much as I used to. My son helps a lot and we connect regularly but he lives pretty far away and it isn’t the same. We have grown closer and we worry about each other.

At my age I feel like some sort of dirty old man if I approach a woman and the chance of meeting someone of a similar age is pretty low. I am working on making more of myself and trying to concentrate on things that interest me but there is always that cover of sadness. And then I realize I am whining."
"I want to have my own family and should be able to have one but my parents are currently struggling with their jobs and my sister needs help for school so I can’t concentrate on just me. Every Sunday at church when the children are called to the front for the blessing, I want to look away but can’t. I see people my age coming up with their spouse and young children in tow and I think “that could be me” but I’m reminded that I can’t have that. I can’t afford to. I’m needed elsewhere."
Christmas. My parents are divorced and when I was 19 I spent Christmas alone. My mom was with her husband and his family. My dad was with his girlfriend and her family. My older siblings were with their significant others and I spent Christmas Eve and Christmas Day alone. I didn’t even get a phone call.
"It‘s Christmas and we‘re opening gifts. My brother makes a rude comments and my dad gets out of his chair and screeches, why dont you just leave! I hate you!. This ended in a knockdown drag out fight, my mother crying alone in the bathroom and me trying to hold back tears as I open a gift under the now empty tree. Im not sure I like Christmas so much anymore. In practice its wonderful but in reality it feels like acid to my skin."
"Back home Christmas and New Year were big holidays. In my home country, my city was the country‘s capital so there were always gigantic celebrations with families, relatives, friends, and I was invited to go to a lot of places to celebrate. Here in Canada, one of my parents has to work on either Christmas or New Year. It‘s sad because now, its just my parents, my younger brother and I during the holidays. My youngest brother passed away a few years ago and we already didnt have a lot of people to celebrate it with in this new country... now it hurts even more that my youngest brother passed away. Usually, we just watch TV during the holidays and depending on whether my mom has work or not, she prepares a big feast for like 4 people. If not, we just watch TV and my dad drinks and locks himself in his room until the next day..."
"It was Christmas 1971. My family was downstairs – maybe a dozen people – and I was getting something in my bedroom. I remember looking out the window as the stars came out, listening to the laughter and bubbling conversations drifting up from downstairs, and a feeling went through me that told me I would never ever have this – a happy family of my own. Sadly, it proved to be true."
"I just had our child after a difficult labor and had my mother come visit us to help out during the first weeks (we lived abroad). Instead my mother was more interested in going out, have coffee with friends than actually be there emotionally for me. When I tried to talk and explain to her that I found the first days of motherhood very difficult and didn’t feel there she was truly being supportive, she told me I needed to stop being emotional and allow her to live her life. The real kicker after this conversation was when she told me that she had put up and was still putting up with dealing with me and my siblings."
"Having to work in the city when everyone else got to go home for Christmas was always a difficult time but the worst was when I moved to the opposite end of the country to make a fresh start after my relationship ended. I lived with my dad and it brought up so many wounds of the past, I never did make myself at home there and the fresh start never came. I developed a drinking problem, made a lot of stupid mistakes that hurt me, and had a lot of people take advantage of my vulnerability. It has scarred me to this day. Now I have moved again, I have many good friends and a support network close by but I still feel alone much of the time because of having BPD. I am afraid of what loneliness makes me do, the risks I am willing to take to avoid feeling alone. I feel so empty inside. Sometimes I don‘t want to be around people so I avoid them but then I feel isolated and lonely, the longer I spend in my own company the more I hate myself and the less I want to see people, so it becomes an endless toxic cycle."
I felt most lonely when I turned 65 and realized that I will be spending the rest of my life with no relatives helping me cross the threshold to death. I’ve read so many obituaries stating that so and so died surrounded by loving family. I will never have that.
"I felt most lonely when I moved cities for a job and 2 years later realized that I had made no connections deep enough in my new home where I could invite someone or be invited by someone for a Christmas meal. I am Muslim by faith but Christmas had always been a special time for me, so it was a crushing blow to me to realize that I was truly alone in that city."
"I talk to myself – for other people. I‘m so alone that sometimes I call out to people that aren‘t there for dinner or to come see something on TV. At work, I see people all day, but I go home to an empty house and stay there until I repeat the process. All of my friends have their own partners and/or families and and I am divorced, my kids are grown and being single at my age isolates you so anymore, I feel the most lonely every day. I had a relationship for about 18 months but one day he decided that he didnt want me anymore which intensified the loneliness. Its funny how you can feel something for a long time but then feel it even more after something like that. As if someone peeled back the layer of normal lonely to expose raw lonely. I suppose perhaps Im at my loneliest during the holiday months because while everyone else is celebrating, I am often times by myself or even worse, surrounded by couples and families. One holiday Im fortunate enough to have my children come home, the other Im not. Its tough and I already feel the sting of it and its not even Halloween..."
"TELL ME THE STORY OF THE TIME YOU FELT THE MOST LONELY.
Loneliness while in a relationship is the worst – laying next to someone and realizing you are so disconnected, no matter how hard your try, you are better off alone. I endured so much emotional abuse, I felt broken. I know I’m not unique in this, and as a single woman in my 40’s, now I have a fantastic life. At this point, I have been single for a few years, and I am really ready for a solid relationship with a good man. I want the physical and emotional intimacy of having a partner, I want someone with whom I can share my life. It is so frustrating when people who have been married for decades and haven’t ever been alone, say to me “you have to learn how to be happy on your own.” I have more than proven I can thrive as a single and can take care of myself. Holidays are the worst, but at least I still have my parents and siblings. I think I should get a dog, maybe host international students. Create a sense of purpose in having my own, non-biological family, so to speak."
"Thought I was in love twice, both guys treated me badly – had to cry for weeks – no-one communicates honestly with a reason why it did not work."
"Now. My sisters and aunt have alienated my mom and me from their lives over the past couple years. We don’t fit into their perfect, snobby lifestyles and think we’re losers. I’m being judged on behavior from my teens and 20s (along their presumptions of what and who I am), but I have changed so much since then. My mom and I may not be as well off as they are, but we’re not suffering either. My sisters and aunt control all family events and we are no longer invited for birthdays, family dinners or holidays. Even though I think they’re pretty much bitches, it hurts to go from big holidays with 30+ people, to just me and my mom. I feel especially sad and lonely when I think of what my life will be like after my mom is gone. I will have no family left."
"My loneliness waxes and wanes. Just recently, I got broken up with in public and was left there, sobbing, by myself. No one stopped to ask if I was okay. I’ve been devastated. I tried to fill my time on the weekend, and I felt like I had no one to spend time with me, so I ended up at a pub by myself and got very intoxicated all alone. I sat on the street for a while, drunk and heartbroken, because I had nowhere to go with my pain.

Just like many others, my loneliness is exacerbated by the holidays. I want to spend my holidays with the people I love, and that does not entail my family. I want to spend time with friends, but unfortunately, my family would never allow that. So I’m forced into rooms with extended family members, while I’m incredibly empty and void inside.

Sometimes, I feel like I’m destined for loneliness, and maybe I just don’t deserve companionship."
I feel the most lonely when I give in to my expectations of what I imagine life should be like. Example: having my parents still alive and having big holiday gatherings with them or wishing I had grandchildren to love and spoil.
"I feel lonely most during holidays and weekends when I don’t have my son. Holidays is a hard time of year overall because I miss family. It’s become harder for me over the last few years.

I feel most lonely when I am faced with a household challenge that is typically a blue job. I have no one to help me figure it out (such as electrical work in my oven and leaves that need to be cleaned out of eaves) and no one to call. Well that’s not true, I have plenty of people to call for help but I have a hard time reaching out. I’ve been trying to ask for help, and lately no one is available. I get it, everyone has their own busy lives and can’t be available when I need it. I feel lonely again because it reminds me I’m single and alone, then amplifies the feeling of loneliness.

Loneliness sinks in again when I have to schedule my holidays at work. Which is due November 15th. I have no one to plan a vacation with. Yes I can take my son somewhere, but that’s not so simple. I have a medical issue, seizures, and where I had a MVA last year while in vacation with my son. This has been traumatic for him. So it’s not easy for me to go places with him alone, because should something happen to me, I have no one to take care of him. Again, I’m reminded I’m alone and the feeling of loneliness (and then sadness) sets in.

I’ve been divorced for 8 years. I was married to a man who is a local in this town. He has a reputation that is not always favourable by some, which leaves the locals avoiding me when it comes to relationships and/or dating. He has been controlling in our marriage, and since I walked out it’s been worse. Since my divorce, I have had experiences where men express their like for me, but because of who my ex can be, they prefer not to have to “deal” with him. I feel that I have been branded in his town, which further makes me feel alone and lonely. I have shared custody and therefore my options of relocating is not great. Most days I’m ok with being single. But it’s because of the examples I listed above, the feeling of being lonely is amplified and acutely at the forefront.

Social media is damaging for us all as well. Loneliness has left me feeling depressed and ironically isolating myself. Being around people do not always make me feel less lonely. I’m some situations I felt more alone.

I am recently practicing yoga. I am doing my best to be mindful and present. Limiting my time on social media. I am practicing being grateful for the great things in my life and keeping myself busy with friends and family. But even with that, the loneliness haunts me and it’s a fight."
"The day my mother died (a long story in and of itself), she had been in the ICU overnight. The doctors came in and told us she had lost all brain activity, and it was just a matter of taking her off the respirator. I was not in the room by myself, but I was the only viable next-of-kin to sign off on removing her life support. One brother was in prison, but the other was only about an hour away. I called him to come and sign with me, and he refused because he “couldn’t do that to Momma.” She had always told us not to let her live comatose – she hated the idea of it. So, I signed my mother’s death warrant by myself, at age 18. I have never felt more loneliness in my life, or more fear, or more sorrow."
"In seventh grade, there was an eighth grader who constantly harassed me physically and verbally, grabbing my thighs and butt, calling me flat, making unwanted advances, etc, and I finally gathered up the courage to tell a friend. They told me that they just liked me, and I was overreacting and I just wanted attention. Nobody did anything and I can’t open up the same way since."
"Second year of university, alone in my residence room, having a panic attack as my floor mates had a conversation just outside the door. Having no idea to communicate to them, feeling a mounting wall blocking out those around me. The special, insidious loneliness that comes from the belief that no matter how kind and genuine they seem, the people you know secretly hate you. When trying to explain the worst sides of anxiety and depression, this is often a story I use."
"I told my sister about our childhood friends having get togethers, and she went out of her way to reconnect with them, after one group get together that I attended, I learned that there had been others that she went to, and even though she knew this was a sorrow in my life, has not made sure that I too was included. I just find myself wondering why am I so forgettable?"
"When I was in elementary school, we moved to yet another state, South Carolina, because my mom was getting back together with someone and I begrudgingly went with her. Not to mention, that guy said that there was a really good job opportunity there so of course we just had to go. I moved there without knowing a single soul and only had my mom to lean on. I was treated quite differently on my first day of school because I was Asian while everyone else just wasn’t. Not the best way to start a new life, especially at my age. My mom was working long hours to support three people and was gone most of the time while the other guy locked himself in his room all day to drink himself out of sobriety, play games, and use up what little hard-earned money she made for gambling purposes. I had never felt so empty and alone; I sunk into depression and didn’t have the will to live anymore."
"I feel the most lonely when I think about my future. As an unwed, childless woman in her 40’s, I worry about dying alone. Once my parents and older sibling pass away, will I still matter to anyone? Will anyone shed a tear if I get sick or pass away? Does my life matter at that point? I do not regret my decision not to have children. For many reasons, it was the right choice for me. But there is a finality that comes when one is childless, yet no longer able to have children. That finality can be a difficult burden to bear."
"I was sick a lot during my teenage years because I didn‘t adhere to my medicine as I should have. My illness wasn‘t something we ever discussed, it was taboo, swept under the carpet. I suffered alone and in silence."
"I was sick a lot during my teenage years because I didn‘t adhere to my medicine as I should have. My illness wasn‘t something we ever discussed, it was taboo, swept under the carpet. I suffered alone and in silence."
"Believe it or not, when I got engaged. Life was supposed to be fun and exciting and my family was happy and his were happy... only he wouldn‘t plan the wedding, or talk about the future or help me, I felt an overwhelming sense of loneliness not being able to talk to friends or family about how I felt, knowing that this may be the wrong thing to do... but not wanting to ruin their perception. Living a life for someone else and waiting to find out where you are going and what you are supposed to be doing, when that someone else won‘t talk to you... that is lonely and it‘s makes me feel pathetic that I allow it."
"As I walked back along the darkening streets tonight, an evening in early May, the birds were still singing and the smell of spring was fresh and floral in the air around me. It reminded me, viscerally, suddenly, of the hill behind my childhood home that Dad and I used to climb after dinner. We’d bring a banana or chocolate mousse and eat them sitting on the bench at the top, looking out at the panoramic views of the city’s old stone and slate roofs.

Sometimes, memories like these fill you with warmth, a welcome gift proffered at an unexpected moment. Sometimes, they just serve to remind you of all the things that are different now. In this case, I immediately feel nostalgic for my Dad and my secret language, confined to those pre-adolescent years; for those familiar horizons, the sense of belonging they provoke; for the irrelevance of the future then, a blurry, intangible time in a child’s mind.

Since moving here, I’ve been lonely most of the time. Even when I’m with newly-made friends, even when I’m laughing, even when I’m absorbed in a talk or a class or a reading, there are always people and places I miss.

I’d already got used to the absence of my city’s old stones, slate roofs, many hills. I’d got used to being an ocean away from my family, my friends, my first boyfriend. But it was different then. Now, I’ve moved away not just from my first home, but also my second, the one I’ve constructed over almost seven years and that I’m still actively shaping every time I return.

When I first moved here, I was frustrated by the knowledge that in every coffee shop and lecture hall, there were bound to be like-minded people, potential new friends. This is a university town, after all. There are all sorts of interesting people here and I knew, tantalisingly, that I was probably walking past them in the narrow historic streets every single day.

It was different in the place that has become my second home. There, the loneliness of the first six months were combatted by making friends and basking in the knowledge that we’d have another four years together in the same place, embarking upon and later completing our first university degrees. Here, there’s barely enough time to finish the reading lists, let alone spend hours over a beer getting to know someone. Given the nature of academic rigour in this place, the former activity often takes precedence.

Now that I’m almost done, the course finishing in a flash of visiting scholar talks, library fines and wine receptions, I am telling myself that those potential friends don’t matter anymore. I am telling myself that I will walk over the cobbles and down the lanes content with my own company, happy in the knowledge that my community is elsewhere and it’s not going anywhere: it’s me that left, it’s me that will return. I am telling myself, as my partner so often tells me from across the ocean (in the other direction, this time), to be happy with what I am doing rather than what I could be doing. Some days it works, and I feel strength in solitude, rather than weakness in isolation.

But some days, when the smell of spring is especially strong, or the sound of silence becomes too loud, it makes me wish for another time, another place. And on those days, I ride it out, I try to write a little, I (often unsuccessfully) avoid reaching for my phone to replicate absent people’s presences with messages (because it’s never the same), and I remind myself that I chose this. I chose to move away and move away and move away again. And equally, I will choose to move back.

In this way, loneliness is a temporary state, and, ultimately, a necessary one. For without loneliness, how could we ever truly appreciate company? Without loneliness, would those memories return to us so visceral, full-bodied, nostalgia-inducing? I don’t think so. It is loneliness, then, that allows us, that gives us the time and space and necessary aloneness, to reflect on all that was and all that is still to come."
"August 2017, it was a sunny summer day. I was sitting in my back yard with my 3 rescue Chihuahuas snuggled at my feet. I was talking to my pups and saying how much I love them. I was all alone, except for my pups and the nature of birds chirping in the cedar trees next to me. I was on social media on my phone, and reading all the posts of others (friends/family/others). They all seemed socially successful in life that day, I observed. My friends/family and strangers‘ posts were those of them going to work, going to school, going to the mall, going out for coffee with friends, etc. I was overwhelmed by the thought, I had no one to call up or text and say Lets get together. I wasnt able to drive (that day due to fatigue) from my Synthroid Im on after my Thyroid Cancer. I was feeling very low self esteem and I wanted a visitor to chat with and cheer me up, but everyone was busy, except for myself. I gave my pups some huge hugs, and that made me feel happier!

Some days are still quite lonely, thats okay. I have learned to accept it as rest time, thinking time, and peaceful quiet time. I make sure to make these lonely days, great days! I start the day by writing, playing with my pups, exercising, listening to music, baking, going to the beach, dancing around the house, watching funny movies, and sipping some good coffee! Everyday, Im thankful to be here to share my story."
"When I try to make a friend and their interests are alcohol and mine are adventures and swords and history, and not only are they they not asking me anything back and nodding off the things I share voluntarily, I have to really work at asking questions to keep them talking about themselves."
"Later in life I wound up in a leadership role with more than forty employees and several direct reports at the company where I worked. It was a high profile position that involved public speaking, television appearances, attending galas, and meeting upon meeting. I was inundated with people coming and going from my office. I had a narcissistic boss who was emotionally abusive. I realized that I was the buffer for all these wonderfully talented people but I couldn‘t really talk about how difficult the experience was for me with anyone at the office. When things became really challenging, I would take long walks, stay in the washroom for longer periods of time, or I would get sick and stay home from work. Even though I had this highly public job, I was utterly lonely."
"Not too long ago I fell into a deep depression where I developed severe anxiety and gender dysphoria. Nothing could fill the void in my heart; my job, cars, friends or even substance abuse. Growing up I was always more inclined to be feminine and couldn’t understand why it was so shameful to be gay or transgender. With constant pressure from my family to not come out I tended to shut down or close myself off from everyone around me. Until I finally burst letting all my feelings out all at once and to such a relief my mom wasn’t angry. Although she still isn’t very comfortable with me being transgender I’m sure one day she will when she sees me happy to be myself. For now I’m still finding my way in this world, often alone and against the beliefs of everyone around me. Shout out to all the renegades out there, just know that there are others even if they aren’t near."
"I was a new mum and had recently lost both my parents. These were profound experiences that affected me deeply, in good and bad ways. None of my close friends had experienced any of this which made it difficult to share what I was feeling. Ultimately I feel I‘m more human because of what I learned from this time."
"I think I‘ve felt lonely throughout my life and I am truly alone except for my dog. Christmas guts me every year. I already accept there will be not even a phone call for me. I have bought a pre-cooked meal and a slice of pie. My evening walk with the dog takes my soul every year for curtains are open into living rooms full of families and friends, I can hear them, sometimes smell their turkey dinners, but most of all I feel all their happiness knowing I will never have it. I get home and get into bed and cry and will the day away with sleep."
"There is no one time I felt the most lonely, I think. For me, lonely has been an ever growing sensation. It multiplies with every realization I have that my old friends don‘t care about me anymore, with every excited thought that quickly dies because I have no one who will want to hear it, and with each event I consider going to then don‘t because I know I‘ll never have as much fun alone as I would with other people. Loneliness lives in my stomach constantly, and I can feel it eating all my organs with each week that passes. It‘s like a parasite. But then again, Im only 18, what do I fucking know."
"I was working on a cruise ship and was emergency disembarked in Barbados for a suspected appendicitis. It turned out to be a ruptured ovarian cyst. The doctor told me I wouldn‘t be able to have kids. I spent 2 days in the hospital and 2 days in a hotel before being flown back to meet the ship. Those days in Barbados were the loneliest I‘ve ever been. I was in pain, I was scared, Id been told something I always wanted wouldnt happen and I had nothing to distract myself (no television or books). I couldnt call my family or friends. Besides the medical staff checking on me, I only had the ships port agent stop by with my passport. It was awful.

3 years later, on my last cruise contract, I was trained for a care program where crew will stay in port with passengers or crew members who are dealing with a crisis. The new program was designed to avoid what happened to me. I cried during the training and told the trainer how important this new program was. It would have made all the difference for me."
"My partner of nearly five years and I broke up. It was not a healthy relationship. My partner was abusive towards me and people knew she could be difficult to deal with. When we broke up, I was the one who had to leave and the queer community that we shared abandoned me and isolated me because my ex wouldn‘t acknowledge the break up and continued to party and go out. I‘ve never felt more lonely in my life. All these relationships I had spent nearly five years putting effort into completely disappeared. People who are supposed to have good politics, and work in social work, or are doulas, took the easy route, fully knowing my ex‘s behaviour towards me was unacceptable. She offered them more social capital than I did and I lost my entire life."
"When I sat in a coffee shop and realized everyone around me was locked into their electronic device. Earbuds in place, there was not an inch of space into which I could start a conversation.

As a society, I believe we are the architects of our isolation. But I‘m hopeful that one day the need for real interaction in a meaningful way will get people to put down their devices and casually strike up a conversation with other people nearby."
I spent two hours alone wandering around an IKEA because I was too nervous to ask people to come with me. I ate two hotdogs and bought nothing.
"I was attending a large church that I had donated my design services to -- I had done the interior design for an entire campus of buildings for them. Both of my children were baptized there and I tried to attend every Sunday I was able. I was in the midst of struggling to understand the burgeoning special needs of my now 3 year old daughter, feeling so daunted, frustrated, scared and alone. I got a text from the nursery, telling me my daughter was throwing a tantrum and asking if I could come back. I ducked out of the Sunday morning service and was walking across the campus to the children‘s building. One of the mothers I knew was out there walking as well. She asked how I was and I admitted to my bewilderment with the health and behavioral problems with my little girl. She looked at me smugly, knowingly, and suggested that if I would stay at home and give my daughter the time and attention she clearly needed, perhaps this wouldnt be a problem for me any longer. I was stunned, shocked, horrified. Every possible molecule of mother-guilt surged up inside me and I realized that she didnt understand. And I wondered if I would ever find a like-minded soul who had walked the path I was on. I felt impossibly alone right then. And I have tried really, really hard to never judge another mothers path. It can be incredibly lonely at times."
The time I felt the most lonely was at the 17km mark of my first half marathon. I trained for weeks and begged everyone I knew to please come support me at the finish line. Not one person came. I knew for sure at km 17 that no one was there for me because you had to run near where the finish line was. I spent the next 4 kilometres feeling sorry for myself.
"To me, one of the worst things about being lonely is that it can often seem like something desirable. Theres something sexy about being sad, alone, tormented by deep thoughts. Drinking in the rain at 4:00 AM listening to post-rock. It feels like youre in a movie (think Ryan Gosling in Drive), and as long as you can keep dissociating from reality, it actually feels good. But that feeling doesnt last long, because its predicated on the idea that if only people could see me now, theyd know how tortured and lonely and sexy I am -- and no one is watching. So when you reluctantly come back to reality, youre tipsy and soaking wet in the middle of the night wondering why you ever wanted to be alone in the first place. And thats when the real loneliness hits you."
"It was my first day on kindergarten, the first time I had ever really been around other kids my age. I was so excited, but of course nervous to meet all my new peers. I remember getting there and my mom had to leave for work, so I waited patiently by myself for the class door to open. I watched as other kids began to arrive with their parents. There I was standing all alone, in the cold fall breeze, watching all my soon to be classmates latching onto their parents and smiling. I stood there for another ten minutes observing all of them. Eventually the door opened and the teacher started to welcome everyone. I looked around as all the kids hugged their parents and said goodbye to them, their parents hugging and kissing them back. I was the only kid there that had no parent to kiss or hug them goodbye, because my mom was a single parent and couldn‘t afford to be late for work.

Throughout the day I was laughing and smiling and completely ignoring what had happened earlier. The memory had completely swept out of my mind, I was too focused playing with all my new friends.

After the day had ended, i soon realized it was time to leave class and go home. Our teacher announced she would dismiss us from the class once she met our parents. All the kids started walking out of the door, practically leaping into their parents arms, blabbering on about how amazing their day was. Their parents all smiled while they rambled on aimlessly.

Me on the other hand......

I had to wait 45 minutes after class had ended for my mom to come pick me up. I sat there, while my teacher just typed away at her computer. The class was silent and made me feel stuck. I just wanted to be like all the other kids in my class. I wanted to be able to hug my mom goodbye, I wanted to be able to leave class on time and tell her about my day. I wanted to be normal, or what I, being five, thought was supposed to be normal. I felt all alone."
Again my husband has deployed after we moved to a new town. I don‘t know a soul here. I feel soo alone. The kids dont have friends and families are provinces away. People are so unfriendly here i just want to go home. This is the most lonely i have ever felt.
"there’s no one time, but i was completely alone and almost fully nocturnal for about 6 months. i’d maybe see family members for about 10 minutes a day, if i was lucky. this was in the pre-ubiquitous internet era, and before i had a cell phone, so i was completely alone. i was dealing with some health issues, so i couldn’t read books. all i had was tv and my dog (when she wasn’t sleeping/hanging out upstairs with my sleeping family members). you start talking to things -- yourself, out loud, your food, the tv, the walls. you develop an even richer inner life, filled with more characters and more fantasy, because it’s all you have. you try to squeeze every second out of possible interactions, because they’re so special and small and fleeting. i’m sort of amazed i survived it."
I went into the car to go to daycare. It took a long time waiting for mama and Thomas.
"After my mum died and there was nobody left who knew all the same people and to whom I could tell news. As a child, realising that almost everyone else had siblings - I had none."
"I was raised as a Jehovah‘s Witness. I struggled to leave the faith for years, living a secret life where I hid many things about myself. I used coping mechanisms of drugs and alcohol because I felt trapped and was severely depressed and suicidal. When you leave that faith you get cut off from everyone in it. I knew what would come and I couldn‘t bare to say goodbye. These were people who I had known and loved for years, some my entire life. People who had told me they would be in my life forever. It was almost five years ago when my mother left my house for the last time, when she realized I had finally really left the faith, I wept but she didn‘t. She just said goodbye. I had no one to turn to because consolation was not possible at that time. It was the loneliest I‘ve ever felt."
