      <p>From the various stories shared, i have came to a conclusion that while everyone may have different experiences with loneliness, 
        the reason behind why we are feeling this way is probably the same. We want to be HEARD and SEEN. Isnt it fascinating? We live in a 
        such a connected world where a call or text to your family or friend is just a button away but yet many of us still expereience this terrible feeling occasionally?

      <p> since you are here now, why not go text someone that you want to connect with but didnt get the chance to because you were too busy.. 
        you never know how your one text could impact the other person!
