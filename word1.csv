"At a party. It wasn’t my scene. The conversation was mind-numbing. Would have preferred to be at home with a good book.Later in life I wound up in a leadership role with more than forty employees and several direct reports at the company where I worked. It was a high profile position that involved public speaking, television appearances, attending galas, and meeting upon meeting. I was inundated with people coming and going from my office. I had a narcissistic boss who was emotionally abusive. I realized that I was the buffer for all these wonderfully talented people but I couldn’t really talk about how difficult the experience was for me with anyone at the office. When things became really challenging, I would take long walks, stay in the washroom for longer periods of time, or I would get sick and stay home from work. Even though I had this highly public job, I was utterly lonely.My loneliness comes in waves. I feel very lonely when I think about my niece back home, and how I’ve only met her once, and haven’t seen her in person in two years. I feel lonely that she gets to hang up on me whenever she likes on FaceTime because I’m not truly physically a person to her. And that can also be a little bit funny. My loneliness comes in waves. I feel very lonely when I think about my niece back home, and how I’ve only met her once, and haven’t seen her in person in two years. I feel lonely that she gets to hang up on me whenever she likes on FaceTime because I’m not truly physically a person to her. And that can also be a little bit funny. I feel lonely when I hear people talking about immigrants in a particular way, because I am an immigrant, even though I don’t look like what people perceive an immigrant to be. I feel lonely that my partner doesn’t like my country’s cuisine. I feel lonely when I want to greet people with a warm hug and kisses on their cheeks, but Canadians don’t really like being touched. I feel lonely when nobody asks me about Brazil, or asks how my family is doing.I’m not sure if there was one specific time, but to me the feeling of loneliness has encompassed my 20s. It’s the feeling that everyone else around me knows exactly what they want out of their lives - the type of partner they want, the career they’re pursuing. I’ve never felt clear about who I am and as a result it has been difficult to define what I want out of my time on this planet. It can be very isolating and, well, lonely to feel that everyone around you is moving forward while you remain cemented to where you are. Loneliness to me is not knowing which direction to step, and watching those around me walk miles ahead without looking back. While I’m happy for them, I just wish I could keep up.Some nights when my depression gets bad, I badly need someone to talk to, and the first time I had a full on wave of depression was the first time I realized I had no one to talk to about it. No one I knew was I comfortable to share it with, and my parents were definitely out of the picture. I was forced to internalize it, and the next day when I went to school I expected people to notice that I was not alright, and that I needed someone to talk to and didn’t know who to reach out to. No one noticed. I realized then that it didn’t matter how I felt on the inside and how well I knew myself if everyone I know sees me as a bright and happy girl. If I’m the only person that actually knows who I am, how does anyone really know me at all? Are we really the people we know ourselves to be if everyone else has a different image of us? Do I exist outside of their main image of me?Whenever I am tired after work, or sick, and want nothing more than to get into pajamas and be comfortable - but then I realize that there is no food in the house or no cold medicine, and there is no one there I can ask hey, can you do me a favor and go get Sudafed, and I have to get back out of my pajamas and trudge out to the market to get it myself. Whenever that happens, I always feel that there is no one who has my back at the little moments when I need it; I do have friends I know would help when I have a genuine crisis, but it‘s someone having your back in the mundane moments that REALLY matters.Last summer was kind of hard. Both my kids are now married and their military lives have taken them far away. My husband was in and out of town all spring / summer doing military training. My best friend got a new boyfriend and stopped doing our usual routines (going to our favorite sandwich shop, doing carpentry projects, hiking, and just getting into mischief). My husband and I found land closer to his work that is actually within a series of small neighborhoods, with people who have similar interests/hobbies. We‘re in the process of buying it and starting a new chapter where we can actually KNOW people we live around. Everyone there seems very nice and relatable. But it‘s also been hard to think about moving from the home I raised my children, and moving away from my best friend. I‘ve been having a really hard time with nostalgia. Music from my youth, thinking about being a child again... and wondering if there will be fun times to be had and memories to be made when I look back on this time in 20 years from now.I was in Boston for a summer internship. I knew two people there from back home who were going to school. One of them was one of my best friends. We had known each other since Kindergarten. I was so depressed and lonely being in a new city by myself with my boyfriend back in California and my family in Colorado. I would go to work and basically come right back home to an empty house. I explored the city a lot on my own but it only did so much. I wanted to see my friend so badly, but she didn‘t have time for me. She had school and her own life there, and I felt like she didn‘t even care that I was in the same city as her, even though we hadn‘t seen each other in a year. One day she finally told me she didn‘t want to see me. She said she couldn‘t be friends with someone who made her feel guilty for not spending time with them. That was not my intention at all, I just really needed a friend at that time. I suffer from depression normally and being isolated in a new city was making it worse. I havent seen or really talked to her since. To make matters worse, right before the holidays another one of my best friends from elementary school back home told me she couldnt be friends with someone who didnt support our president (Trump!) and blocked my phone number and me on all outlets of social media. She was one of the only friends I had left that still lived in my hometown. Now being home for the holidays is just a lonely reminder that I will never have those friendships that I cherished so much again.As I sit alone, in the upstairs spare room of my parents house, I come to terms of just how lost I feel. It has been two years since my family and I have moved almost 3,000 miles away from my old home, and even though moving is second nature to me, tonight, the feelings I have encountered are nothing short than devastating. Mixed with seasonal depression, homesickness, and the stress a future I have yet to figure out and stabilize – I attempt to complete the endless amounts of worksheets and forms to pass my high school classes, as well as college classes I dual enrolled in. I am already behind. Tonight is also Halloween. The fact alone, that I have done nothing at all to celebrate my favorite holiday, nor acknowledge its existence this year, due to my work load and unrelenting stress leaves me upset. In such a state that it‘s painful to continue on working. I can barely recall any months past August of this year; it ends up in becoming a blur of me counting down hours until the next deadline, and consuming unhealthy amounts of caffeine and sugar to keep my body awake. Maybe the worst part about it is my entire family is out celebrating with their friends. They are out trick or treating, partying, and conversing with people they know and love while I‘m left crying all over the couch because I don‘t have a single friend in the entire state. But maybe that‘s just selfish. My best friends, who live now very far away from me, are partying too. They have a group chat open and keep sending me photos of how much fun they are having, making me sick to my stomach. Eventually it got so painful I had to silence the messages and put my phone on the other side of the room. Deep somewhere, I wonder if they even care about me anymore, or if they keep up appearances because I try to remain friends with them.Ever since I got married and came to live in another country. It has not been easy. I feel really alone. The people in this country are very friendly but they are not looking for friends. It’s very hard to find a group of friends here. That, and the language barrier. I haven’t felt this lonely in my life. I often think it was not worth to get married, he’s a good person and tries his best but it’s not enough.After college, I moved to a different state for work, where I had literally no family or friends prior to moving. I had such high hopes of making a fresh start for myself and finally meeting my squad, that Friends-esque type family that you build for yourself and aren‘t born into. Well, finding that is easier said than done, but I felt that I had found that with my coworkers. We‘re all around the same age and enjoy spending time with one another. However, as time goes on, I‘ve found that we‘re drifting apart and don‘t really connect the same way we used to. We used to all go to lunch together, and would round everyone up so we could all eat together in the break room. Recently though, I looked up from my computer and realized that I was all alone in the office. It was 11:30, and everyone had gone to lunch without me, and never told me that they were leaving. I felt so abandoned and isolated, that it triggered my loneliness again and I‘ve been struggling to cope since. Ive found that being left out of group conversations, jokes, etc. is a big trigger for me, and so even though this incident was small, it felt so deliberate, that Ive been wondering why my squad has decided that Im not important enough to them to include on a regular basis anymore. What did I do wrong? Why dont I warrant their interaction, companionship and camaraderie? Thankfully, I have a wonderful best friend that lives in the same city as I do now, and my family (my parents in particular) are the people Im closest to in the world, so I know that I can pick up the phone, day or night, and talk to the people who love me more than anything else in the world. Im so incredibly grateful for this, but I long to have the squad goals that everyone else my age seems to have. Then that leads to feeling guilty for not being appreciative enough of the people that I do have in my life, causing a vicious cycle of loneliness, guilt and despair.""I went to a party that my two friends were hosting. I got a haircut the day before, and even though my hair was short, I really liked it. I walked in the door, and everyone went, Your hair! Some people said nice things, but most people just commented on how short it was. I went to go surprise my best friend, and she turned around and couldn’t stop laughing. She told me it was the worst haircut I’ve EVER had, and that I looked like a guy. I felt my gut shrivel up a bit, but I brushed it off, pretending not to care.Later on at the party, there was music playing. Half the people were dancing, and the other half were sitting on the side and judging (including my best friend). I got sick sitting on the side, so I got up to dance. A couple of my new friends dancing hyped me up, and then I saw my best friend laughing at me.I was actually making an attempt to dance, so I kept doing it, but no one was paying attention to me, and I felt just really alone. I called my parents to pick me up.I’m still friends with my best friend, but I don’t know what to do. She’s nice to me most of the time, but she just has these mean things she does. I can’t ditch her because she’s one of my only friends, and the oldest, and my parents love her.I wish I could just be me.""I created a network on the sunshine coast for women who felt lonely. As a result of that I was at a 60th Birthday Party and everyone who was at that party the host had met through the group. It was a great night, lots of laughing and dancing. I was the only one who‘s partner didn‘t come along, and I sat at the back of the room watching, feeling very proud but also so lonely.My best friend who was practically my sister started ignoring me. I still don’t know why. I’ve tried reaching out and letting her know how hurt I am and how much she means to me. She hasn’t acknowledged how I feel or explained herself. I know she might be going through her own stuff, but the lack of the most basic acknowledgment still has me feeling anxious, angry, helpless, taken advantage of, and worthless. She was the closest friend I had. If she could do this to me, my other friends could too. This made me feel so alone and paranoid.I‘ve never been in a relationship with anyone. Hell, I‘ve never even kissed anyone. There have been a couple of girls who I‘ve liked, but none of them were ever interested in me. Whenever I hear other guys my age talk about girls, they‘re always talking about sex. How they would like to try a threesome, or anal or god-knows-what. I would just want to have somebody to hug me. Someone to hold hands with when we walk, someone to talk to endlessly, someone to go to concerts and festivals with me. I want someone to sleep with, literally. Stare at the stars and falling asleep in each others arms. It all seemed so hopeful 2 weeks ago. I matched with this girl via Tinder. She was everything I ever hoped for. Kind, super pretty, lived relatively nearby and (at least via text) super nice to talk to. We chatted for about 2 months before she finally agreed to go on a date with me. Everything was set, location, date, time, you name it. I had made countless preparations, bought her flowers, practiced how to fold crane birds in case she went to the bathroom during our date, thought about jokes to tell her, printed out a staple of funny question cards we could ask each other in case there would fall an awkward silence. I had even washed my shoes, or at least made an effort to. But the day that it all would happen she texted me. She wanted to cancel the date since she felt like she wasnt ready yet to start a (new) relationship. I felt so sad, broken and alone. I had been looking forward to this for god-knows-how-long. I replied as kind and understanding as I could, which she really appreciated, but she had already made up her mind. We have kept contact since then, and Ive tried to arrange a second date. This time just as friends though. It might happen sometime next week. I remain hopeful, I cant wait to see her and talk to her in real life sometime. Even if we would become only friends Id still be super happy.I’m in a city which allows for so much adventure and experience. So many people to meet and things to do. I’m surrounded by opportunities. And yet I’m lonely. I feel so alone. I‘m young and I know I have a future ahead of me but right now I‘m living in hell. I‘m being told that I‘m living the best years of my life but if this is what Ill feel for the next 70 years, then I dont want to experience the rest. It’s scary to feel this isolated, so removed from your own life. I cant name when I felt the most lonely because its not predictable or constant. I never know when my mind is going to sabotage me and am never prepared so the feeling is always the same; miserable and agonising. I think I’m only starting to starting to realise it’s not solely a feeling, it’s a living. It’s a part of my life and myself and its a part of human nature. I know Im not alone in my feelings but still, I feel lonely. P.S. Im only sad so when I say I dont want to experience the rest of my life I dont meant that in a literal sense. I am in fact looking forward to growing up and hopefully growing away from this loneliness.My wife and I used to watch a lot of TV and movies together. It‘s been a struggle to get her to watch anything anymore with me. Finally I did get her to sit down and watch something we had been wanting to watch for a long time. A cringe worthy moment came that made me laugh and I turned to my wife and said Can you believe they did that? She‘s on her phone and after a long pause she just says Uh huh. She doesn‘t stop or even look up. At that moment I wished I had someone to share that moment with. I realized I had no one else and the thought of finding someone terrified me.For me loneliness isn’t an emotion that fluctuates so much as something that feels like a permanent part of my being. I learned at a young age that I could only count on myself for emotional support and that reaching out for help or appearing vulnerable is a bad thing (rationally I know this isn’t true and I’m in the process of unlearning some very bad habits and coping mechanisms but it’s not easy). I spent most of my life framing my loneliness as something empowering - I was completely self sufficient and didn’t need anyone’s help for anything, desperate to ignore the innate yearning for intimate human connection. I’m quite social and I have good friends but I’ve never been in a truly intimate relationship. The loneliness has become so much a part of me that, even though I recognize it’s sad and harmful, the idea of not being lonely is scary and confounding.I was in the hospital for a surgery. My boyfriend at the time didn’t visit because he couldn’t be bothered, and my friends all said they were too busy to show up. That night, I saw them on someone’s Snapchat story at a party. What stung the most however, was me knowing that had they been in my position, I would’ve crossed mountains to come running with get well cards, flowers and whatever else they would’ve wanted. I’ve done such things countless times before after all. Yet, I couldn’t even get so much as a visit. The only person who showed up was my mother, who raised me on her own. It made me want to never do a kind thing for anyone ever again.I felt most lonely the night the man I loved got married to someone else. He was my best friend for four years and the only man I ever really connected with. When we broke up, it was due to mounting pressure from third parties, not because either of us wanted out. I was young and stupid, and realized too late that I could have fought harder for our relationship. 2.5 years later and I still miss him every damn day. The worst part is, he started dating someone else within a few months and never looked back. My best friend went to his wedding.I had a serious bout of anxiety come over me after I found out that my cancer came back. I remember sitting on my futon in my dorm room, alone, just crying for hours, just telling myself that I was going to be okay. No friends were there, and my family was on the other side of the state. All I needed was a very long hug from someone, literally anyone, but I didn’t want to seem weak. I eventually reached out to a therapist. It was the best decision I had ever made. I’m a lot better now.I feel the most lonely when I‘m writing JavaScript. It feels like my soul is in an infinite loop, spiralling into the void with no help in sight.I was recently diagnosed with a mood disorder that has made my emotions unrecognizable to myself. I‘m angry or sad or anxious without cause. My partner is afraid of me because I can‘t check my reactions. I‘m in treatment, but I don‘t think its working, and I cant return to intense psychiatric care until the end of the year or Ill lose my job. I feel like Im going crazy and everyone in my life is just watching it happen.I think everyone thinks they can save someone. That is the trap I fell into. My wife came from an abusive family and she wanted nothing more than to escape and I became her knight in shining armour who would whisk her away. Even during the early years of our marriage her libido was low, at least that is what I thought. I have come to realize that the truth is she despises being touched and avoids any physical contact when possible. I think the true depth of my loneliness became obvious after our son was born 15 years ago. A few months after he was born I was trying to get romantic with my wife who had been totally unresponsive since the pregnancy and I remember clearly what she said now that I have my son, I never have to have sex with you. I grew up in a cold German family and all I ever wanted was someone who would touch me and hold me, and now 27 years after saying I do, I am even lonelier than I was growing up.Today I sorted through yet another box of my husband Roy’s life. The cardboard box contained an assortment of documents, a few photographs, the receipt of the purchase of his first new car, a collection of cards from birthdays past, university and high school diplomas, expired drivers licenses, receipts of car insurance payments, and a few other markers of his life before me. I had always believed I knew everything about Roy’s life while growing up. Now I find empty spaces and surprises to fill them. Roy had once taken me to his University campus in Alberta, Canada, I had attended several of his High school reunions, listened to many stories from his adolescent years, met old friends and buddies from his Military years and yet here are new facts and new faces to complete the picture. I found two High school diplomas: one issued in Roy’s hometown, from Fergus County High School in the year 1954 and another one dated in1955 from Canada. Perhaps the diploma issued in Canada was a requirement for admission to the University of Alberta? I also learned that Roy served in the National Guard in Montana and yet he was drafted into the Army. I find it interesting that the VW beetle he purchased from the factory in Germany cost him 5,500 DM, which at that time was equal to 1,375 U$...and while I turn these documentations around in my hands, I felt a growing need to share my emotions with Roy. I wanted to dive into memories with him and also relive the ones we did share, sit in that seafoam green Volkswagen and explore Europe and the US together one more time, the beginning of our relationship becoming fresh and new again. As many memories flooded my mind and the realization that we never again would share these memories became reality, I was surprised that my sadness focused on him, on Roy. In those early years, it was him who created them. While I rejoice with happy memories he no longer can. It is up to me to nurture and keep them alive. There he is, sitting across the table from me. The expression on his face tells me that he has noticed the tears rolling across my cheeks. He looks puzzled and uncomfortable. In these long years of the advancement of dementia, his life disappeared with the slow loss of memory – he lost his wife, his children, and finally himself. How can anyone cope with such tragedy? The process of experiencing fear, denial, anger and shame must finally give in to total darkness. He and I shared these stages differently, but together. In the end I am the keeper of these memories.A few years ago, I got laid off and my car was totaled in the same weekend. I couldn‘t find work anywhere and I had no savings, so I started walking and taking the bus anywhere I needed to go. As money got tighter I started selling my clothes, books, and furniture...but it wasn‘t enough. I lost 30 pounds because I couldn‘t afford groceries. I got fired from a contract job after two weeks when my boss saw me walking to work. Finally, I started missing rent payments. I had to do the thing I dreaded: Get the courage to ask my mom if I could borrow money. She blew up at me. She wrote me an email telling me that the only thing I cared about was money, I was always an ungrateful brat, and I didn‘t deserve anything from her. No one has ever understood what it was like to grow up with a mother like that, and I still feel incredibly lonely that I can‘t talk to anyone about it.Here. Now. As I write this, and the day before. The day after I submit this. I’ve lost my way in the forest and if I could do it by myself, I’d be out by now. There is no significant story attached. I stayed inside and kept myself away from everybody out of a shame that was self-given but never deserved. There is so much in my life to be picked up and put back together. There is so much I’ve given up under the false pretense that I deserved nothing. I am slowly working my way into allowing myself the sweetness of vulnerability, but until I reach that... I’ll always be a strange alien girl whose only company is a fluffy little cat (and even he prefers to hide under the bed alone).This is kind of recent. My grandma passed away in January of this year and she used to be one of the closest people to me, so, ever since she died I just can‘t shake off this feeling of being alone. She used to be my neighbour so we saw each other almost everyday because she needed help with a lot of things in her house and at night we even watched soap operas together, so we always kept each other company. I‘m not saying I loved every single minute I‘ve spent there, because sometimes she was very easily annoyed and I am a crazy mess, but it was nice and now it just seems like a part of me was ripped and I‘m all alone again.I feel lonely every time a go to work. I have been in this position for five years and have a large amount of knowledge in this area of medicine. There is a clique within the group that for lack of better terms are the “mean girls” - they do whatever possible to damage the person that is a “threat”. I am a threat because I am well liked by other staff and the management - because I do my job well, and I do extra where and when it is needed. This makes the clique look bad, because they do the bare minimum. Being the target of the “mean girls” means you are left out of dinners, parties, breakfast plans, lunch, camping trips, etc. I get to hear them talk all about if after the fact (telling me “you were working”) or hear them try to quietly make plans. I have been left to complete a large wound dressing change in the operating room, only to be asked the next day “Where did you go? We assumed you left early” (knowing full well I had the late case). While this shouldn’t bother me, it does horribly. It has made me realize how alone I am and how I have focused on medicine and being good at what I do – which should be a good thing, but they have made sure to let me know it isn’t in their eyes and that I am not wanted. This feeds the anxiety and fear that since I don’t belong with professional peers, that maybe I am truly not good enough outside of work for anyone else. It is crippling to be worn down to this – and to realize I am truly alone.After 32 years my husband left our marriage. We were living out of state and I decided to move back to the area where I grew up and raised our two children. I was looking forward to reconnecting with old friends and family but I had been away for awhile. I realized you really can‘t go home. No one seems to have the time or desire to reconnect with me even though friends and family all say the love me and are so happy to have me back in the area. My children live out of state and both have very successful careers and significant others. In the past two weeks I haven‘t had any contact with anyone except for my daughter texting me here and there. I mean I go shopping, to the gym and run errands but that‘s about it. I am having trouble finding a job. I was a stay at home mom devoting all my time and energy in making a good home for my family. I never thought that this would be my life at 60. Moving out on my own in my first apartment a couple of months ago. Drinking and smoking are the only things that make me feel better about myself. Nobody will ever know how lonely I am. Being a young professional, with a degree and a career, a new fancy car, a closet full of fancy clothes, knowing full well that I am good-looking and smart, yet all these outwards signs of success don‘t mean a thing when you have no one to share them with. Feeling that emptiness inside on a daily basis and knowing full well that we are at an age when people have their circle already and wondering if I will ever feel the opposite of loneliness.I feel so silly even writing these words out. One of the times I felt the most lonely was last year, one of my best friends had just been broken up with, and I was writing positive things about her in a list to make her feel better. I wanted her to read it so she‘d know how amazing she is. She was hanging out with another one of her friends, so I was tagging along, a foot or two behind them. They were talking and laughing and I felt like my list was so unnecessary and I felt dumb. She finally read the list and she hugged me and told me how much she appreciated me and how good of a friend I was before going back to her conversation. That night I texted her and told her how I felt left out and how sometimes I felt like I was a liability without directly telling mentioning it was because of her other friends. After sending it, I immediately started regretting it because I sounded so clingy, like I was saying that my best friend wasn‘t allowed to have other friends. I realized that I always end up clinging when I find someone that even remotely likes me and I end up driving them away. It‘s a defense mechanism for me growing up, no one gave me the validation I crave now.As a caregiver for many years to my ageing mother, who has multiple mental and physical health problems, I am confronted with both her loneliness and my own. Her inability to function on her own and her loss of her essence and personality have resulted in her not having any friends who truly know her and appreciate her for the fun-loving and sweet person she is. Everyone just perceives her as crazy or needy. As for me, I miss my mom and get angry at her for her helplessness. I have no siblings or partner to share the work and emotional strain with. Friends are casually supportive, but mostly I am isolated and exhausted by the effort of just keeping her afloat. Institutional care and social programs are sorely lacking, especially if you are not wealthy. I am now losing touch with joy and my personality too.So many examples, yet one that stands out is wanting a divorce from my marriage. I had only been married for a few years and my family and friends turned away from me. I felt defeated and I had nobody close in my life to talk to about my feelings and what I was going through; I felt so lonely. Luckily, I learned that by trusting my instincts it helped me discover more about my needs and wants in my life. Regardless, loneliness is something that doesn‘t seem to go away.My junior year of high school. I was going through an eating disorder and an abusive relationship, but I couldn’t tell anyone close to me for fear of getting in trouble. I remember sitting in my Algebra 2/Trigonometry class (I was failing), right after my teacher looked me in the eyes and asked me if I needed help, if I was okay. I sat in my seat and felt the world come crashing down. I didn’t think there was another human being on the planet who would be able to help me or understand. I felt like I was going to feel like that forever. I remember feeling like everyone around me knew exactly what they were doing. No one else had a hard time understanding the lessons or falling asleep at night. I couldn’t even cryI just felt so empty and alone.Hands down Pride weekend. Pride is billed as the time when you can get together with your chosen family and celebrate however you identify as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. However, from my first Pride as a recently out-to-myself-and-close family 22-year-old, I‘ve just felt very isolated. Everyone seemed to be in a group of friends, or holding hands with their special someone. I felt invisible and unwanted. Since then, I‘ve become more involved with some parts of the gay community, so at least I have things to do and people to talk to during the celebrations. However, it still feels like I‘m totally alone as I walk through the streets of the festival.I was sitting with my friends and looked around. All of them paired up in couples, with pets at their feet, children...I never felt quite so alone, so othered, so different and isolated, as I did in that moment while surrounded by loved ones.When I was 36, I was singing in front of a crowd of about 100 people. I suffered a stroke. Cue the laughter and the"
