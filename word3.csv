"wet eyes I showed my passport and ticket. As I was sitting down in my seat on the aeroplane, he rung. I sobbed, an air hostess asked if I was okay and I mouthed to her “saying goodbye”. She nodded and gave me a hot towel for my face, her kind gesture only caused me to sob more. The phone connection disintegrated and I was asked to switch off my mobile. Sometimes I question my decisions, the actions directed by a heart worn on the sleeve.The choices made by an individual can brutally effect others, I don’t think I’ve ever felt more alone in my life. In October, it will be two years since I was stood up and to this day I still cry over how I was treated, the lack of respect, the lack of answers, the silence.When I crossed the finish line of my first marathon for my 26th birthday out of state, I realized that no one would be around to be proud of me. Other marathoners had family, spouses, or significant partners waiting and when I crossed it was silent. Many people had gone home because it was a small race and I‘m not a fast runner. I grabbed my medal and went to my hotel room, alone, as though my biggest athletic feat that I‘d trained for months and months to achieve...had never happened. I posted it on Facebook, but the likes will never be the real thing. Always around the holidays. It always sucks as I don‘t have anyone to be with. I haven‘t had a romantic relationship in forever.My most lonely is currently. I‘ve always been a slightly sickly person, but the summer of 2016 it got ramped up to 11. I lost my job, I was vomiting blood, and a bunch of other gross stuff. I was weak, exhausted. I‘ve gotten my main diagnosis, but there is no cure, just gradual decline and decay. At Christmas this year, my favorite uncle (who only sees me once a year) uncomfortably said hello & then spent 5 hrs avoiding me with my other uncle. This man and I used to talk for hours because he genuinely enjoyed my views and opinions, and how he won‘t be in the same room as me. It made me step back and realize that all my friends have basically acted like Homer Simpson in the gif where he slowly steps back letting the shrubs engulf him. Even my ‘best friend who used to be my patient advocate at times and check on me daily... I hadnt seen her in 4 months and the only time she talks to me is if she needs to vent because she knows Im around. Im lonely because an illness I didnt ask for, that is killing me, has left me homebound and uncomfortable to look at because it took too long for the doctors to catch it. Aside from when my boyfriend gets home from work, I spend my day entirely alone. And most of his time after work is running errands and cooking and picking up the slack so... still alone. Alone and a burden.Whenever I make a mistake. I feel unforgivable, as if any chance I stood of being loved fades to black.I felt the most lonely when I had my first panic attack due to my anxiety, but felt I had no one to tell about it. It was an absolutely terrifying experience. I didn’t know what was wrong with me. I was too scared to ask for help, and instead of reaching out to others I started to separate myself from every “friend” I had and my anxiety began to consume me.I started drinking alcohol for the first time in my life. I broke religious and community barriers, that was crazy.There comes a time when you’ve retired and your kids find excuses not to hang out with you. When I was their age there was an energy and vibrancy to everything. You wanted to fill every moment with friends and activities. I’d spend time with my parents regularly as a kind of obligation but not so much quality one on one time. Wouldn’t invest the kind of spontaneity I gave to my friends and peers. I suppose that’s the way of things. I never gave a second thought as to whether my busy schedule pained my parents the way it pains me now. I might have made more of an effort.When my marriage ended and I was up at the cottage we rented every summer, and my daughter was away at camp. I was heartbroken and utterly alone. I journalled my days to survive it. Here is an actual excerpt: 7:10 trying to get out of bed. 7:20 am out of bed making coffee. 745 back in bed. 810 crying on floor in bathroom. 8:30 made myself go for a walk. Saw falcon. 10:00 how many hours until bedtime and this day is over? Being alone at Christmas that year was a close second.One of my first sleepovers in fourth grade. At that age a lot of kids are finding their sexual orientation and talking about crushes and such. As per usual truth or dare came about and the most asked truth- who do you have a crush on. If you answered no one you were pushed til you let out an answer, but for me the answer was genuinely no one. Honestly, I felt a deep sadness inside me, I had a feeling that I would forever be alone and never find myself. Instead of showing my true self, I decided to pick a random kid in our class and go on with life and girls thinking I liked this boy. I felt out of place, not accepted for myself. In around 7th grade, I found the terms asexual and aromantic. While it was reliving to find myself, I still have to put on a persona everytime that dreaded question comes up or whenever my aunts and uncles come over and ask when I‘ll have a boyfriend.It was a Saturday night and I was in bed. I’d had a bad week, having it been really busy plus I’d Also messaged a guy I was interested in earlier in the week but there had been no response. Saturday nights, late in bed are the hardest. I was sad because he hadn’t replied and then I started to think of the fact that he was gone and that there was no one else and from there my thoughts spiralled out of control until I was crying and I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I sat up in bed, trying to catch my breath, tears streaming down my face until I finally relaxed. Since that night, I vowed to never get too disheartened about my singleness. To never get too attached to a person so that I didn’t have to feel this way again. This year has been a good year and most the time I’m okay, but when the loneliness sneaks in, it’s hard to shake. I’m still on a path to accept that maybe me being single is how it’s supposed to be right now and I think about it everyday, but I’m learning to sit with the loneliness and accept that it’s okay to be lonely, but really, you’re never alone.Moving to Las Vegas with my husband (then boyfriend). He was offered a job and I had just graduated so I didn’t hesitate to come with him. I’d had surgery before the move so I would be unable to do anything for some time after. I decided to leave my cats and resolved to get them at a later time, and brought my ferret. We moved on a Saturday, and by Monday she was not doing well. She passed away later that night, after only 3 days, and I don’t think I ever felt so lonely in my life (it really was just a coincidence as she was older, but the timing couldn’t have been worse). My husband would be off at work all day, and I was stuck in a 1 bedroom apartment by myself all day until he came home. I sat alone all day with no one to talk to, nowhere to go, and I couldn’t even unpack any boxes because I’d just had surgery. Everyone I knew but my husband were all still back at home, across a state line in California. They were living their lives, going to work and socializing and hanging out with friends while I sat in my quiet apartment, lonely and feeling sorry for myself. The silence was deafening, and was the most honest and truthful thing I’ve ever heard. It has become easier to be alone, and in fact I sometimes prefer it. But sometimes the loneliness comes with it and it comes crashing down hard and even the radio or my favorite music does nothing. Even in a room full of people I know or are at least familiar with, I still feel lonely much of the time. I suppose it’s just part of my makeup now, imbued in my DNA. Not connecting on a deeper, fundamental level with someone. Having to hold back who you truly are. To me that is when I’m at my most lonely. I am trapped alone in my head with my thoughts unable to share with anyone else.As a stay at home mom it comes with the territory. I know I chose this but I also didn’t really have the option to go back out into the world after. Every day being alone takes a toll on you mentally, you have your online mom groups but it’s just not the same.I truly do not remember. Too many years without emotional support except for the professional kind. Right now I am dealing with the recent death of my mom. I am really taking a closer look at grief and how it feels to me. I am trying to write it down. Grief is very lonely.""One of my oldest friends was sleeping with the person I was in love with behind my back and then didn’t have the guts to tell me, so I found out from my lover. The week my terminal project for grad school was due. Suffice it to say, it took me another year to graduate. It took months to recover from the feeling that I really couldn’t trust anyone; even my closest friends, and that people didn’t care about me enough to think about how their behavior might hurt me. I’m mostly better now. It’s been 11 years and my mind still brings it up as a reason not to trust that people will really be there for me when I need them. That I am alone in the world and always will be.All that said, I am with a wonderful person who loves me dearly and we’re happily planning to spend the rest of our lives together. But the feeling of loneliness never goes away, and there is always a nagging thought in my mind that I will die alone and forgotten in the streets. (I know, rationally, that there are people in my life who would never let that happen, but that knowledge doesn’t make the feeling go away.)""When my one true friend who knew my life inside out passed away. She was my safe place.Standing on the driveway the day one of my brothers moved to the US for university. My family is insanely close and still are, despite my parents being divorced. That said, when the person who I could relate to most in the world moved away I was terrified. I was so happy for him and his new chapter but felt insanely lonely. I was 23. My parents split at 22. We decided (my two brothers and I) that no matter what we’d always be there for each other. I am the oldest and was left in Toronto with the youngest. I didn’t know how to relate to him or open up to him because we (as a family) always protected him from the ugliness of reality. I think ultimately my loneliness came from guiltiness (I didn’t know how to relate to my youngest brother) and selfishness (I didn’t want to face my parents divorce alone).Every single Mother’s Day since 2005.I broke my ankle and didn’t see anyone besides my husband for weeks at a time. I could stave off the loneliness at my job but literally trapped in bed 24 hours a day was soul-crushing.I was sleeping alone in the guest bedroom of a friend’s house. I could hear her and her boyfriend laughing. I knew I was going to bed alone while they had each other. It made me feel so lonely.By far, when I was sexually assaulted by a stranger in broad daylight in 2014. That was the first trauma i personally experienced and it was just after my first year of college. I was not sure of who I was at the time and was in a period where i was losing touch with high school friends and struggling to make friends in college in a program I did not enjoy very much. The people I was close to did not know how to help me through that experience, which made me feel lonelier than ever.I developed an eating disorder at the age of 15. When I was 20, my parents found out about my problem and over the next year, I attended a drop-in group therapy program in order to appease them. I wasn’t ready to give up my coping mechanism or dig into my trauma at that time, so I basically just got better at hiding my eating disorder, which continued to control and haunt my daily life for many years to come. At age 27, I was finally fed up of having my life controlled by food and exercise, and I started attending an intensive holistic therapy program at a well-respected center in Toronto. I saw a team of specialists 2-3 times a week over a period of 4 months, and eventually tapered my treatment to single weekly therapy sessions. I worked hard as hell to dig into the key causes of my eating disorder, including sexual trauma and an emotionally abusive upbringing, both which resulted in anxiety, substance abuse, and compulsive behaviour problems. I am privileged and fortunate to have had access to the program that eventually allowed me to heal from my eating disorder, but it came with a huge price. That summer, as a student, I used a student line of credit and OSAP to pay for the $14,000 of treatment I received. None of it was covered by the government or my limited student healthcare benefits. Despite an ongoing rocky and tumultuous relationship with my parents, I reached out to them for help paying for my treatment, but they said no. Since eating disorders are still so stigmatized, and because I’ve always prided myself on being independent, I was ashamed to reach out to anyone else for help. I still struggle to this day to make ends meet, but I’ve managed to get by, and now that I only have one more year of school left, there is light at the end of the tunnel. I know deep down that I’ll be okay and somehow find a way to make it through. I am resourceful as hell, and I’ll figure it out. But it really hurts that the people who should’ve been there for me more than anyone else in the world simply weren’t. Thankfully, due to my therapy work, I now know that my parents’ lack of support isn’t a reflection of my worth, and is instead a result of their own personal trauma and hurt. I’ve built myself up in the ways that my parents never did, and put loving people around me who make me feel supported and seen and valued. Working through my eating issues gave me the foundation to be able to finally face my sexual trauma, which has allowed me to be able to reconnect fully with my body and learn to love and care for it. I still get sad when I think about my relationship with my parents. I have effectively cut them off for the past 2 years, but for now I know it’s better than the alternative. I don’t think I could have done the healing over the last 2 years that I did if I was still in contact with them. By disconnecting from something destructive, I was finally able to start connecting with myself and my life.I felt lonely when my father and brother has to leave the country and i stayed in Jordan with my mom, it was a week full of grief but I got over it with some friends.Moving abroad five years ago began the most lonely period of my life. I knew I had to pursue something that I couldn’t find at home, so I left behind friends and family to do it. I looked forward to meeting scads of new incredible people but that hasn’t panned out. It’s me, my work, and a seemingly endless chain of frustrated attempts to cultivate intimacy. Have I made the wrong decision? Should I go back home and have close friends, but no career or sense of purpose? I find that I can’t.The loneliest I’ve ever felt was when I realized that the love of my life didn’t want to spend time with me. To put that much power on another person, any person really, is a choice though. It’s as if I had this expectation that if another human being actively sought me out, I would feel validated as a person myself. I’ve since come to realize (or possible delude myself into thinking) that loneliness is simply a feeling of low self esteem. When I am with others that care to have conversations with me, I feel worthy. I’m currently working on my perspective of self worth.The loneliest I’ve ever felt was when my marriage hit a very dark patch and I thought my husband and I were going to divorce.I threw a going away party – a huge, crazy fun one, and only 6 or 7 people showed up of the 40+ I had invited. And that’s when I realised I had spent so much time chasing quantity in friends after all of those years alone that I had somehow ended up lonelier than before.I’m sitting with some of my friends and that day everyone is talking about the latest gossip of a girl getting together with a boy. I tried to ask a question about them, as I really didn’t know what was going on. Everyone laughs and is like “oh it’s nothing.” They go back to talking and a couple minutes later, a girl says Why are you so smart Ree. You can’t hang with us if you are. To bad you have no idea what’s going on. Clearly you aren’t as smart as everyone says”. That was like a punch in the stomach. I’ve always been the ‘smart kid‘, but I didn’t realize it had put me so far apart. Now, no matter who I try to talk to, I know that there’ll always be that loneliness in me, because I had yet to find another soul who understood me.It was when my ex married someone after only six months of knowing her. Before that I was with him for 10 years, even had a child together. It makes me feel so alone, and often makes me wonder if he truly did love me. It’s been 3 years since our separation, and even though things got bad at the end of our relationship, I know I still love him. What tore me up was they just recently got a cat that resembles the one he inherited from his deceased uncle, and became my cat so to speak. He was my therapy cat, and is no longer alive. My ex for some reason today told me the cat that him and his wife got is the ghost of our other one. Sounds stupid, but it tore me up inside. He knew how much I loved that cat, and just picturing them picking out a family pet together makes me feel so alone that I no longer am a part of his life. Also, not even sure wtf his intention was telling me that. Sorry, this is long. To me, loneliness is when you are surrounded by people and they see you and you see them, but no one really ponders each other’s presence. People see you as just some colored blur in the background that they’ll never have a want or need to interact with. To them, you’re just another prop. This also tends to be vice-versa. This realization hit me kinda hard, that every stranger you see is just another person you pass by in the daily stream of people, and chances are you’ll never see them again. You’ll never learn what their name is, what their favorite color is, what foods they enjoy etc. And that’s exactly what you are to them as well. Every person you walk past or glance at has a life that is just as, if not more, complex than your own. I was 9 when I noticed this and it freaks me out to this day. I remember sitting in those little chairs and staring at the teachers and suddenly wanting to know more about his wife and his son. I wanted to know the hobbies and interests of the kids in the class across the hall. I stared at everyone with eyes the size of dinner plates. Third grade was crazy, man.Sorry, this is long.

Third grade was crazy, man.I’ve felt lonely many times, mostly because I never felt like I belong here. Having Asperger’s doesn’t help either, and I only knew I had it a couple of years ago. Until college I was never invited to parties or any other social meetings. Once I tried to get together with old high-school friends only to realize that I had virtually none, as only one of them showed up with her (now ex-) husband. Later I learnt that the other people I invited were actually at another meeting. A much more popular person had a birthday party which of course I was never invited to. This is another circumstance, this is my hometown when I get back, meet people and they never ask about me, but for my sister to me.""Moving into my new apartment, I had to organize my belongings all by myself and realized I had nothing to unpack represent my relationships, friendships and social existence. It was a realization that I have not shared my life story with another person.Every day I go down to the cafeteria at work and find it difficult to locate an empty table to eat at by myself. Groups of co-workers sit together socializing and sharing their daily experiences. All the tables seat 4 people and I feel guilty when I do find one taking up all the space by myself. I have this tone to my presence that emulates leave me alone, I don‘t want anyone to sit here. I find solace in my own quiet moments. I don‘t have to talk and find peace in my isolation. It lingers for some time until I see a group laughing or debating some verbal topic I can‘t make out being too far away. The envy passes and I remind myself anonymity is better than having to fake being interested. Is this selfish? I don‘t have interest in hearing about other people‘s problems or drama. In those moments it reminds me what lonely really is. The burden of others’ issues is exactly why I make this conscious decision to eat alone.""I was having a pretty rough time with school and soccer (I had a major soccer tournament coming up the next week and it was going to be my last since I was graduating, and my team hasn‘t been in our best condition). I told my parents about it, they replied with: so stop playing. It broke my heart because in front of their friends they would boast about me playing but in times like these, that was like emotional betrayal. I later came to the conclusion that I can‘t count on them for emotional support.We were doing Christmas shopping because I pushed for it. I left my home country almost 2 years ago and I still have a hard time calling this place home. I moved here because of my husband. He grew up here. I think he feels safe here. Anyway. I have probably two friends here. No coworkers. No family other than our pets. I pushed to go Christmas shopping for his coworkers and our two friends. I started crying when I walked past the toy section at the store. I remembered how much I enjoyed going shopping for the coolest toys for my nephews. I love giving gifts to people and it’s not completely selfless... I love to see their reaction when they see what I got them. To know that I surprised them and made them smile...it means so much to me. And then it hit me. I have no one here. I can’t do shopping for them because it’s virtually impossible for me to get the stuff there later. It made me really sad. I missed the toy hunting, but more than anything, I miss having my people with me. I feel terribly alone.When my mom called some people dumb and disgusting just because they’re gay and it really got me because, I, her own daughter is a gay woman. The woman I thought will understand me the most turned out to be the wrong person.When I scrolled through my instagram feed and saw pictures of girls I considered my best friends having parties without me, of course with big smiles and fun captions like “Love my besties sooo much????” and “sisters for life”. I cried for hours. Where was I in all this? Was I not good enough? Was I too fat, annoying, ugly, or stupid? What was wrong with me? I wondered. High school is only two years away, but to me it sounds like a paradise that I can’t reach. All I hear is how wonderful high school is and how I’ll make all my friends there. I honestly can’t wait any longer for it. I’m kind of hoping for a high school heaven.""Very recently, I realized that every member of my family was not the same person I knew growing up anymore. After my parents got divorced, I shoved all of my emotions to a vault in the back of my head...and it wasn’t until I went away from home and to school that all of them came rushing back. For a while, it left me more numb than before...but then it evolved into an all encompassing loneliness. My dad is a member of a religion which discourages communication with non-members, and he does not support me or my decision to go to college in favor of religion, and refuses to speak with me. My mother and brother both have substance abuse issues, mostly with prescription drugs and alcohol. It’s hard to feel like I have any family left.However, I’ve tried seeing it this way: your family does not have to be the family you were born into. I’m trying my best to find family in the incredible people who have helped me along the way.""My mother died when I was 38 after a short illness. We had shared an apartment together and then I was on my own. For really the first time in my life. I didn’t realize how much I did for her or how much my life was connected to her life. I lost my way and lost my purpose for being. I struggled for a long time trying to find meaning in life and my purpose for still being here. I knew when she was alive that my happiness revolved around making my mother happy. I have always found making other people happy has made me happy. I struggled with suicide and sought out professional help. I found it didn’t really help me. I ended up going to a naturopath who listened and did acupuncture and that helped. Also, I determined that I needed help and finally asked my friends for help. When I had a bad day I would call a friend and talk. The hardest part was asking friends for help but was the start of my recovery. I learned that I want to be here and that I can make other people happy. And that helping other people is a great focus. I volunteer in my town and try to help charities. I also help my friends and family. I have found purpose and in doing so found myself and happiness. So now I share my struggles with others to know that they are never alone. Always someone there to help. Just have to reach out and ask.It was after my dog had died. She had been sick for months, but she had been recovering. Slowly, but surely. One day, I was walking her at night, and she leaped over the porch stairs as we were going home. She was going too fast for me, so I pushed the button on the retractable leash. She tripped, hitting her leg against the bricks. Her health plummeted, and I still haven’t forgiven myself. I cried myself to sleep for months, and I felt so guilty. I never told anyone this. They just assumed I was sad she had died, and I didn’t want them to blame me again. I hated myself so much.My fiancé and I had a long distance relationship for a year and a half. I always made the trip and subsequently the effort for us to be together. I moved to be with him. We had a baby and got engaged. For the last five months he’s been working out of town, home every second weekend for 48 hours. We had no idea it would be so hard for us – we had managed a LDR for so long. But we’re unable to cope this time around. He rarely calls, texts to ask about our child. And when he’s home he tries to swing back into our normal lives and we both fall flat. I feel like he has no consideration for what I go through, being alone. I just want his empathy. I moved for him. And he left anyways. I feel like a child complaining. But my heart aches.Being diagnosed with cancer when you’re 16 is the loneliest experience on earth. You’re under 18, so you’re still treated in the children’s ward. But you’re not 5, and the books, toys and decorations in the ward don’t appeal. No one in the hospital is your age – they’re either very young or over 50ish. Your friends and your boyfriend stop talking to you. You spend more days than you can count in a hospital room with the door closed and the blinds drawn. You feel so physically awful so it’s not like you can run away, and there isn’t a single person on earth that you can relate to. You are 16 and you are facing deep depression, loneliness, and death, all on your own. I’ve never felt more lonely in my entire life.The most recent time, I hitch hiked across the country to Haida Gwaii, BC with two friends. We parted ways on a bad note in Alberta, and I continued on by myself. I was feeling pretty low the whole trip thus far. Haida Gwaii is already about 6 hours of ferry off of the mainland. I was suddenly in the most beautiful, ancient forest I had ever set foot in, but was struggling to enjoy myself, as I was faced with a lot of why I had wanted to leave home in the first place.I felt the most lonely the day my husband of 32 years died and I went to sleep in our bed without him beside me. That was 2 years ago and I still feel lonely every time I come home and close the door behind me and realize it’s just me. All the things my husband and I did together before I now do alone. Even the most mundane things like going grocery shopping, having a cup of tea, watching a favorite show on television remind me that he‘s not here to do these things with. He made everything fun and could always make me laugh. Without him I feel lost. It’s as though I‘m just floating around in limbo.Pre-breakup phase of my relationship. I was having all these doubts and feelings within myself. I wasn’t happy. I knew I couldn’t give him the happiness he deserved. The relationship became stale, and slowly I started to resent him. In the 5 years we have been together I feel I was only there for him, and not for myself. When the rotary ribfest came to town, I went down to it with some recently made friends. One in particular I have been speaking with for awhile. We knew each other as kids, but that was it. Eventually we met again in the last few months, and rekindled. He became my outlet for trying to understand how it was I was feeling. I didn’t want to accept that this was happening to me. After I said bye to my friends I walked down to the secluded area of the lake. I sat there and I felt so alone. I cried, I cried a lot. Coming to the understanding of feeling alone in a relationship is one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do, along with ending it. We try so hard to please our partners, but when you seemingly do everything for them and none for yourself, you lose yourself. It’s hard to find yourself. I’m extremely thankful to have my friend back in my life to help me understand what it is I’m feeling because I’ve lost myself so badly that I can’t even determine it.When my pet rabbit died, I just realized she was meant everything to me. Without her, I seem just all alone and now I have to face to the truth that ‘I am all alone‘ .Getting through the rut of life, making sure everything is going smoothly. Life is so busy, work, home, kids, husband. But no friend. Everyone is busy. I go out to malls and coffee shops, when kids are at school, free time, sipping coffee all by myself, watching people come and go but none recognizable, no one to talk to. It’s been so long, I’ve forgotten how to make friends, forgotten what to talk about, gotten used to my solitude - actually not, still hoping. At home, hubby is so busy with work and life troubles that he’s always in pensive thought in front of the TV. Doesn’t care if I put on a special perfume, or eyeliner, wear a new dress or part my hair different way..... That’s not even on his agenda - as long as food is served to him. And he passes out in front of the television due to his hectic day and tiredness. My role as a single mother to my kids including hubby, single caretaker of the home, and support to my family is compared to a tree giving shade to all, bearing fruits and making them strong but lonely inside. Desperately need a friend to chill out but don’t know how.The time I felt the most lonely was when I was 16 and my mom found out I was gay. She cried for 3 hours, made me pray to ask God to change me, made me watch homophobic sermons, told me I was going to hell and that I ruined her dreams of becoming a missionary. I stayed in my room the whole day and cried. None of my three siblings came to check on me or asked me if I was ok. I could hear them laughing outside of my room door, ignoring my pain. I had no friends to call or to vent to. I had myself and all I could do was cry.I remember in highschool, I associated"
